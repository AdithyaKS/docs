ody":"What is Workato?\nWorkato helps you automate business workflows across cloud apps, on-premise apps and employees. e.g. automate quote to cash business process which may involve Salesforce, Netsuite, Bill.com, Apttus, etc. Workato combines an enterprise-grade workflow automation platform with the ease of use expected from consumer apps, enabling biz users and IT to quickly build workflow automations.\nThe integration problem\nThe average enterprise uses over 1000 different apps. These frequently include both cloud-based and on-premise applications. In addition, personal and business productivity applications such as chat, social media, calendering, and the like are a key part of daily work and data from these is often unintegrated with other business data.\nWithout automated integration, organizations cannot leverage the full power of data in their multiple applications, re-enter data multiple times across applications, constantly context-switch across applications to accomplish tasks, and so on.\nThe challenges of integration\nAutomated integration solves the problem of data silos and manual workflows. But if you are going to automate transactions that span applications, then these processes must be reliable, secure, and manageable. Business and IT users need visibility into the running integrations and the capability to take appropriate action if an error or exception occurs.\nA viable integration solution must be able to handle the complexities of real-world problems. Real-world integration problems often require more than just transporting single data objects across applications. They may require multi-step processes with business logic, workflow capabilities, one-to-many or many-to-one data mappings, and other such challenges. Too, many applications typically are customized for a particular business, and integrations must handle these customizations, since they are a part of the organization’s business processes.\nSome of the issues we see with integration solutions today:\n\nPowerful integration products are oriented toward technical users, while citizen integrator products sacrifice capability for usability\n\nCitizen integrator products need to be enterprise-grade in terms of reliability, scalability and security\n\nAdding new, complex integrations can involve long implementation times spanning months, while new apps are coming online much faster than that\n\nIntegration platform products are relatively high cost, sometimes costing more than the applications being connected\n\nIT needs visibility into the integration processes. Where necessary, it should be possible for IT and business users to collaborate to create and manage integration solutions.\n\n\nWorkato addresses these issues with an enterprise-class integration tool that can be governed and monitored by IT, but with the ease of use and low barrier to entry expected from consumer applications.\nEnterprise-grade foundation\nThe Workato platform has a powerful feature set to handle real-world problems, including the integration of applications, data and people. Both cloud-based and on-premise systems are supported. The runtime system is designed for security, robustness, reliability and high performance.\nCitizen integrators\nWorkato is the only integration platform that was built from the ground up to support a single design interface for developer/IT and citizen integrators, ensuring that citizens and IT have access to the same ease-of-use driven productivity improvements, and at at same time offering citizens the same power and capability available to IT.\nConversational integration\nWorkato provides a chat based (Slack, Microsoft Teams, Cisco Spark, IBM Workspace, etc.) bot building platform for building compelling UX centered around integrations and workflows.\nIT Governance\nGovernance is a key requirement for any platform that allows business users to work with corporate data. Workato Aegis is a management tool that provides cross-enterprise visibility into users/usage, integration processes and the applications they connect. Workato Aegis supports assigning differing levels of responsibility and visibility within the platform, and enables collaboration between business and IT users. It enables implementation and enforcement of policies to improve security and governance across all Workato users within an enterprise.\nExtensible platform\nWorkato’s platform is extensible to add support for new applications beyond the many that are available pre-built. A powerful and configurable REST data connector allows integration to many systems without writing of code. Workato also provides a Connector SDK that handles and abstracts multiple aspects of application and data integration for cases where custom development is required. Existing connectors can be extended via the SDK or via adding functions from the REST connector. In addition, a public API allows control of recipes from third-party applications.\n"},"workato-concepts.html":{"url":"workato-concepts.html","title":"Concepts","keywords":"","body":"Concepts\nHere are the core concepts and terminology that you'd need to know in order to use Workato.\nRecipes\nRecipes are automated workflows built by users that can span multiple apps, e.g. moving new Salesforce accounts into Zendesk as new organizations. Each recipe comprises of a trigger and one or more actions that are carried out when a trigger event is picked up.\nWhen recipes are started and become active, they will run automatically in the background to listen to trigger events and carry out recipe actions. When they are stopped and become inactive, they will cease listening to trigger events.\nHowever, when a recipe is started again, it will pick up all the trigger events that occurred since the recipe was stopped. i.e. stop functions like pause.\nYou can set recipe visibility to be public or private. When they are set to be public, any Workato member can see this recipe, and make a copy for their own use.\nAll recipes have a unique ID that identifies them.\n\nRecipe IDs can be viewed from the URL on the recipe page\nThe recipe above has a trigger and just one action. The trigger is New Salesforce account - this trigger will fire whenever a new account is created in Salesforce. The action Create Zendesk organization will create an organization in Zendesk each time the trigger event occurs (i.e. when a new account is created in Salesforce).\nTriggers\nTriggers determine what event to listen to in order to execute the actions described in a recipe\nTrigger events can occur in apps (e.g. Salesforce, Jira, etc.), can be a timer driven (fires at a certain time or interval), occur when a new line is added in a file, etc.\nDepending on the available API, Workato can receive trigger events in real-time, or check for the occurence of an event periodically (i.e. polled).\nSteps and actions\nRecipe steps are executed every time the trigger event occurs. Recipes are required to have at least one step. The most basic step for a recipe is an action e.g. an action to create an organization in Zendesk.\nWorkato steps can be actions, conditional actions, list actions, actions that call other recipes, try/catch, etc.\nYou can read more about recipe steps here and actions here.\nBlock\nData tree and pills\nEvery step including triggers brings data into the recipe. e.g. a new employee in Workday trigger would bring in employee data. This data is made available in the recipe via the 'data tree'. \nThe individual data fields are called data pills. You can use the data pills in subsequent steps. You can read more about data pills here.\nThe following is the output datatree for the trigger New Salesforce account. This datatree contains all the variables known to us and available for use whenever a trigger event occurs.\n\nOutput datatree for New Salesforce account trigger\nFor example, as seen in the screenshot, whenever a new Salesforce account is created, we're able to get the following values for this particular new Salesforce account:\nAccount description,\nAccount fax,\nAccount ID,\nAccount name,\nAccount number,\nAccount phone,\nAccount rating,\nAccount site,\nAccount source,\netc.\nThese values can be used in subsequent steps of the recipe by being passed into input fields, as covered next.\nInput fields and fields mapping\nTriggers and actions have input fields. Input fields are how triggers and actions are designed to carry out customized workflows, and they can take in variables (datapills) or constants.\nWhen we insert variables (datapills) or constants into input fields, that's called fields mapping. You can read more about fields mapping here.\nThe following is an expanded view of the Create Zendesk organization action. In this view, we can see two input fields: Name and Notes.\n\nInput fields for the action Create Zendesk organization\nMapping variables\nThe variable Account name has been mapped to the Name input field. This means that for every new Salesforce account that is created, the account name of this Salesforce account will be used as the organization name of the Zendesk organization that will be created. For example, a new Salesforce account named Sattei Winery will in turn create a Zendesk organization named Sattei Winery.\n\nInput field with variable mapping\nMapping constants\nOn the other hand, the input field Notes has a constant mapped to it - the words \"Synced over from Salesforce.\" This means that all newly created Zendesk organizations created via Workato will always have the words \"Synced over from Salesforce.\" in its Notes field.\n\nInput field with constant mapping\nHere's an example of the new Zendesk organization created via the above mapping:\n\nNewly created Zendesk organization Sattei Winery\nConnections\nFor a recipe to communicate with apps via actions and triggers, it has to be authorized to interact with apps. This authorization is referred to as a connection. Connections are not tied to a recipe - a single connection can be used by multiple recipes. You can read more about connections here.\n\nSalesforce and Zendesk connections from the recipe view\nJobs\nEach time there is a trigger event, the actions in the recipe are executed. The entire flow of each trigger event through the recipe is called a job. Jobs can be successful (when actions are executed successfully), or have errors (when an action results in an error). When an error is encountered, further actions are not executed. \nJobs report\nThe job report gives a high-level summary of the all the trigger events processed by the recipe. The entire flow of each trigger event through the recipe is called a job.\nInformation such as date, time processed and job IDs, can be found here. From this jobs history page, users can view more detailed information about a job by clicking on it.\nYou can read more about job reports here.\n\nJobs report page\nJob details\nThe job details page provides step-by-step input/output details of a single trigger event as it is processed by the recipe. This page is useful for troubleshooting recipes as users are able to view the data passed into each step and the resultant output returned after each step was executed. You can read more about jobs and job details here.\n\nJob details page showing the syncing of Salesforce account Myers Brewery to Zendesk\n"},"connections.html":{"url":"connections.html","title":"Connecting apps","keywords":"","body":"App connections\nFor every app your recipe interacts with, Workato needs to be authorized to communicate with the apps on your behalf. Workato typically uses the apps API and it may require Oauth based authorization, or API keys, etc.\nThis authorization is referred to as an app connection.\nIn many cases recipes will require a valid app connection before triggers and actions can be configured, to retrieve custom objects and fields, picklist values and other information ('meta-data') that helps with recipe construction.\n\nRecipe prompts user to connect to their Salesforce organization. You will notice that the picklist is greyed out. This is because the recipe needs a valid connection to Salesforce to get the list of available Salesforce objects.\nConnections are created when a user authenticates with the app via Workato, and gives permission to Workato to access the data. Each connection should correspond to one app instance, hence multiple recipes can and should utilize the same connection if working with the same app instance.\nAuthentication\nAuthentication (or authorization) usually occur the following standard ways, although there are some apps with custom authentication flows.\n\nOAuth2\nOAuth1 (and variations)\nBasic authentication\nAPI key or secret\n\nIn each of the highlighted authentication flows, an app user has to authorize Workato with the permission to access app data. The exact permissions Workato will get to read from and write to the app usually corresponds with the permissions of the connected app user.\nFor more information on connecting to a specific app, refer to the specific app connector documentation.\nExample: Authentication flow for Salesforce\nThe following recipe requires both Salesforce and a Zendesk connections, which are both OAuth2. The Connection tab within the recipe shows further details about the app connections.\n\nExample recipe\nThe following shows the Connections tab. Zendesk has been connected, but the Salesforce connector has no connection established yet.\n\nRecipe without a Salesforce connection established\nClicking on the Connect button generates a popup that requests for Salesforce login credentials. Because Salesforce utilizes the standard OAuth2 authentication flow, usernames and passwords are provided only to Salesforce. Providing these credentials assure Salesforce that the user is giving permission for Workato to access their Salesforce data.\n\nOAuth2 authentication popup for Salesforce\nAfter providing credentials, Salesforce will show up as connected. Now the recipe can use this connection for construction and running.\n\nRecipe with Salesforce and Zendesk connections established\nIntegration user\nWorkato recipes typically automate workflows for a company or a department, on behalf of many users. i.e. the integrations will work no matter who created an invoice or a ticket. This requires that the connection used has broader permission that spans multiple users. As a result, the connected user is typically a special integration user created just for integration purposes.\nFor example:\n\nA recipe that moves new Salesforce accounts into Zendesk as new organizations will need read access to Salesforce accounts and write access for Zendesk organizations.\nA recipe that moves new Salesforce cases into JIRA as new issues will need read access to Salesforce cases and write access for JIRA issues.\n\nApps have different granularity when it comes to defining user roles and permissions. Refer to the specific connector documentation for more information on required permissions to connect to the app.\nUsing connections\nTypically a company may only have a single instance of an app and they may have another instance a sandbox for testing, etc. So a user would need just one connection for multiple recipes that work with the same app instance. \nIn cases whereby there are more than one app instance to connect to, e.g. when working with sandboxes and production organizations or teams, multiple connections should be created, with each connection authenticated with each separate instance.\nMost Workato connectors allow only one connection to an app within a recipe.There are some connectors which allows you to work with two app instances within the same recipe. \nHere is an example where the same recipe works with two Saleforce instances i.e. primary and secondary connectors.\n\nExample recipe\nThe recipe requires two Salesforce connections.\n\nPrimary and secondary Salesforce connections\nRefer to the Secondary connectors article to find out more.\n"},"recipes/building-recipes.html":{"url":"recipes/building-recipes.html","title":"Building recipes","keywords":"","body":""},"recipes/triggers.html":{"url":"recipes/triggers.html","title":"Triggers","keywords":"","body":"Triggers\nSome basic trigger rules\n\nEach trigger event will be processed only once. i.e. no duplicates\nTrigger events will be processed in the same order as when the events where created (in the app)\n\nTrigger types\nTriggers can be classified into different types based on how they check for and retrieve new events\nPolling,\nBatch,\nReal-time,\nScheduled,\nClock/Timer\nPolling triggers\nPolling triggers check for new events by periodically querying the app to see if new events are available. The polling frequency is determined by the type of Workato plan, and can be as low as 5 minutes.\nEach poll may yield multiple events ready for processing i.e. a single poll can result in several jobs being created. \nWhen the recipe is first started, the polling trigger fetches all events after the From date. Subsequently, polls are made at regular intervals as dictated by the plan type.\nWhen the recipe is stopped, polling triggers stop fetching events from the trigger app. However, if the recipe is started again, polling triggers will fetch all events since the recipe was stopped.\nExample: Polling trigger\nA Workato account on the Business plan has a 5-minute polling interval, as displayed on their polling triggers.\n\nTrigger hint regarding the specific polling interval\nThe recipe polls every 5 minutes for new accounts created in Salesforce, and fetches any new accounts. If there were multiple accounts created, each will result in a new job.\nIf the recipe is stopped on 1 Feb 2017, midnight PST, it will cease to fetch trigger events. However, when the recipe is started again, lets say on the 10 of March midnight PST, Workato will fetch all Salesforce accounts created since Feb 1.\nBatch triggers\nBatch triggers are similar to polling triggers in terms of how they fetch new events. But, where polling triggers will create a new job for every trigger event, batch triggers will create a new job for a group of events. This group size i.e. batch size can be specified by the end user as part of the trigger configuration. Typical values for batch size are 100.\nBatch triggers are generally used for increasing throughput.\nFor further details about batch triggers, refer to the Batch processing article here.\nReal-time triggers\nReal-time triggers are usually built on top of an asynchronous notification mechanism. Real-time triggers typically require letting the app know that you are interested in a specific event, and then when that event occurs, the app will send a notification. Webhooks are one such mechanism. The advantage of such a mechanism is that there is no delay as well as it is efficient because you are polling every so often to check for new events.\nReal-time triggers supported by Workato (this excludes HTTP real-time triggers) using polling at start i.e. when recipe is first started, the recipe does a poll to fetch all events after the From date. \nScheduled triggers\nScheduled triggers are executed at specified days and times, hourly, daily, monthly, etc.\n\nVarious schedule options for Salesforce scheduled search trigger\nAt the scheduled time or interval, this trigger will fetch all events matching the specified criteria. Also, unlike other triggers, scheduled triggers will return events that have already been picked up previously.\nScheduled triggers will return events in batches, similar to how batch triggers work. Users can specificy the maximum batch size. For e.g. if the batch size is set to 100 and 420 new events are identified, 5 new jobs will be created. The first four jobs will have 100 events each and the fifth will have 20 jobs.\nClock/timer\nAdd definition and example.\nSince/From\nThe Since or From setting enables fetching of historical trigger events from a specified date and time. i.e. instead of picking up new trigger events (events created since recipe was started) this enables picking events that have already occurred.\nIn the example below, the New Salesforce object trigger has a From date as 1 Jan 2017, midnight PST and the 'accounts' object is selected.\n\nSetting the Since date for the trigger. Trigger will only pick up new accounts created since midnight of Jan 1, 2017\nWhen the recipe is started, only Salesforce accounts created after 1 Jan 2017, midnight PST will be picked up, as viewed from the created date column on the job report.\n\nJob report shows that only Salesforce accounts created after Jan 1, 2017 were processed\nIf the trigger was New/updated Salesforce object, only Salesforce accounts created or updated after 1 Jan 2017, midnight PST will be picked up.\nHowever, not all triggers have the Since/From parameter. For such triggers, the date and time from which trigger events will be fetched is predetermined by default, usually as an offset from the time the recipe is started. Common values are:\n\nWhen recipe is first started\nAn hour before recipe is first started\nA day before recipe is first started.\nThis offset is usually communicated in the trigger hint for the connector.\n\nThe Since/From value can only be set once, and will be locked from further changing after the recipe has been started for the first time.\n\nTrigger hint regarding the default offset of 1 hour ago for Google Calendar\nTrigger conditions\nTrigger conditions are additional rules that define what kind of trigger events should be selected for processing. e.g. You can specify that only Salesforce accounts from California must be procssed.\nTrigger filters are evaluated by Workato i.e. Workato retrieves all trigger events, and then filters out the ones that do not meet the rules specified in the trigger condition.\nTo add a trigger condition, check the Trigger IF checkbox. The trigger datatree will appear, displaying the variables that can be used to formulate the trigger condition.\n\nChecking the Trigger IF checkbox brings up trigger condition fields to be configured\nDefine the trigger condition. The following ensures that only Salesforce accounts with a Warm rating value will be picked up by the trigger. Values are case sensitive and should be exact.\n\nDefine the trigger condition\nTo add an additional trigger conditions, select from the OR or AND in the picklist. The selected operator will define how all additional trigger conditions will be added.\n\nAdding another trigger condition with the OR operator\nDefine the additional trigger condition. Values are case sensitive and should be exact. The following ensures that accounts with a Hot rating value will also be picked up by the trigger. Notice that from the third trigger condition onwards, trigger conditions will be combined with the previously selected operator (OR or AND).\n\nDefine the additional trigger condition. Subsequent trigger conditions has to use the same AND operator\n"},"recipes/steps.html":{"url":"recipes/steps.html","title":"Steps","keywords":"","body":"Steps\nRecipe steps can be actions, or control flow statements that help you describe business logic.\n\nVarious recipe steps available in recipe editor\nAction step\nActions carry out an operation in your target app, usually a create, update, or search operation. Each action requires a set of input fields and typically return data i.e. output data tree.\nExample: Action\nThe following step carries out a Search organizations action in Zendesk. The input fields on the left shows the available fields to search for a Zendesk organization by:\n\nName\nTags\nNotes\nDetails\n\nIn the following case, the Search organization action is carried out by name.\n\nMapping fields to an action step Example recipe\nWhen the Search organizations action has been carried out, Zendesk returns data about the organizations found, if any. The output datatree displays available fields for mapping in subsequent steps.\nIn the following case, the Update organization action uses the ID field from the Search organizations action to identify which Zendesk organization to update (ID field as highlighted).\n\nMapping fields to an action step Example recipe\nConditional action step\nConditional actions will only be carried out if the specified condition is true. All actions indented within a conditional action block will be carried out only if that condition is true.\nExample: Conditional\nThe following recipe has two conditional steps:\n\nIf Zendesk organization was found, update Zendesk organization\nIf Zendesk organization was not found, create new Zendesk organization\n\n\nRecipe that uses conditional steps to decide whether to create or update Zendesk organization Example recipe\nIn this example, any job can only proceed through either one of the conditional steps, as the Zendesk organization must have either been found or not.\nRepeat step\nWhen working with a list of items (e.g. a list of invoice line items), you may need to carry out a set of actions for every item in the list. The repeat step helps you do that. Actions indented within a repeat block will be carried out for all items in the list.\nThe input to the repeat step is a list. Actions within a repeat block, should  use data output by the Foreach datatree. This ensures that every item in the list is processed.\nExample: Repeat\nRefer to the example scenario of syncing Salesforce accounts (using the batch trigger) to Zendesk as organizations.\n\nRecipe that uses the Repeat step to iterate through list of Salesforce accounts Example recipe\nIn this example, the trigger returns a list of Salesforce accounts. Since Zendesk does not support batch actions, each Salesforce account must be added one at a time to Zendesk.\nThe list datapill has to be passed into the repeat step. When the input list field is selected, only list type datapills are usable in the datatree, as shown below. List type pills can be identified via their stack icon.\n\nMapping a list data pill into the Repeat step's input list field Example recipe\nDatapills from the Foreach output datatree should be mapped to ensure that values from each list item are used when the action is repeated. For example, if two Salesforce accounts are fetched by the trigger, using pills from the Foreach datatree ensures that the Create organization action creates a Zendesk organization with the data from the first Salesforce account on its first iteration, then with the data from the second Salesforce account on its second iteration.\n\nUsing datapills from the Repeat step's datatree. This ensures values from the list being iterated through are used. Example recipe\nThe following displays the mapping from the Foreach datatree.\n\nDatapills are mapped from the Repeat step's datatree Example recipe\nFor further Repeat step examples or more info about list processing, refer to the List management article.\nCall recipe step\nCall recipe will run another recipe (named a callable recipe). Callable recipes are like functional calls in programming languages. They offer an easy way to resuse recipe logic. \nYou should note that callable recipes are executed synchronously. i.e. the calling recipe will be blocked waiting for the called recipe to finish processing.\nCallable recipes are an advanced feature in Workato that you can read more about in the Callable recipes article.\nStop step\nThe stop step ends a single job from being processed any further. It is usually used in cases when there is a an error in the business logic and further processing of the job is not required.\nThe stop step can be configured to mark the job as a failed or a successful, depending on business logic. \nExample: Stop\nThe following recipe expects all Salesforce accounts to be present in Zendesk as organizations. In cases where no corresponding Zendesk organization is found, the recipe will stop processing further actions.\n\nRecipe that utilizes the Stop step to send email and end job Example recipe\nAny job ran by this recipe can proceed through either one of the conditional step, as the Zendesk organization must have either been found or not. If not found, the job will stop at Step 4. If found, the job will not carry out actions within the conditional step (Steps 3 and 4), instead only updating the matching Zendesk organization.\nThis recipe marks the job as an error, so that the recipe owner will take notice of this job and attempt to rerun it.\n\nConfiguring the Step step's error message Example recipe˚\nAction with error handler step\nThis step, allows you watch for errors in actions, and when an error occurs, take remedial actions. It is similar to try/catch concept in programming lanaguages. \nCommon remedial steps are to notify users of the error via email or error messages in the app, or to carry out a rollback (i.e. reversing the job by deleting any created or half-created records).\nThis step consists of 2 blocks: the Monitor actions for error and the On error block. Actions to be monitored for errors should be within the Monitor block. If all actions are successful, the On error block will be ignored. However, if any action in the Monitor block results in an error, the actions within the On error block will be executed.\nExample: Error handler\nThe following recipe tries to update the Zendesk organization right after the search step, irrespective of whether any Zendesk organizations were found. In cases where no matching Zendesk organization is found, the Update organization action will fail.\n\nRecipe that uses the error monitor to monitor failures in updating Zendesk organizations Example recipe\nAs the recipe catches failed actions within the error monitor block, failed Update organization actions will be caught, and the recipe proceeds to carry out steps within the On error block. In this case, it seems that the only reason for the update failing is because no matching Zendesk organization was found. Hence the remedial step creates a new Zendesk organization.\n"},"recipes/actions.html":{"url":"recipes/actions.html","title":"Actions","keywords":"","body":"Actions\nEvery connector makes available a set of actions. Apart from connectors, Workato makes several utility actions available (e.g. create pie chart, get file from URL, etc.).\nActions can be grouped into the following types\nCreate,\nUpdate,\nUpsert (create or update),\nSearch,\nGet,\nDelete,\netc.\nWe will use the Zendesk and Salesforce connectors to illustrate these actions. You may visit the Workato recipe here and install them into your own Workato account if you would like test out these actions yourself. \nCreate\nThe Create Object action allows you to create any standard or custom object. In Salesforce, creating an account requires at least an Account Name to be stated. \nCreate action will typically return an ID that can be used to look up the newly created object. Sometimes, the entire object (with all the fields) will be returned. This depends on the API Workato uses to connect to the apps.\n\nUpdate\nThe Update Object action allows you to make changes to existing objects. The input to this action will usually be data that will uniquely identify the object to be updated. \nIn this example, it will the Salesforce Account ID.\nUpdate action will return the ID or the entire object (with all the fields) of the updated object.\n\nSearch\nThis action is used to search for an object given a set of data that help identify an object.\nSearch will return all objects matching the specified criteria. i.e. Search returns a list of objects.\nIf no objects are found, search will return an empty list. i.e. Search will not throw an error. This will cause downstream actions that depend on the results of the search to fail.\n\nGet\nGet is similar to search, but is more pinpointed - it requires a unique ID identifying the object to be passed. If object is available, it will return the details of the object.\nIf the the object is not found, get will thrown an error. \nIn the case of Salesforce, using the Get action on an Account will require you to input the Salesforce Account ID. \n\nUpsert\nUpsert is a combination of search, and create or update. Upsert will first search to see if an object exists, if object exists, it will update it otherwise it will create a new object.\nThe Salesforce upsert action will perform a search for the object based on the object ID, create the object if it does not exist, else perform an update on it with the input field values.\n\nDelete\nDelete actions allows you to delete any object. The input to this action is usually an ID that identifies the object to be deleted. Most apps do not support delete, consequently, Workato does not have broad support for deletes.\nAs the nature of this action can irreversibly lead to lost data, it is best to be cautious and understand the implications when using this action in Workato recipes.    \n\n"},"recipes/data-pills-and-mapping.html":{"url":"recipes/data-pills-and-mapping.html","title":"Data pills and mapping","keywords":"","body":"Data pills\nData pills are output data from a trigger or an action step. They are variables that you can use in mapping business logic into recipe steps. e.g. to create an Zendesk organization from a Salesforce account you will assign data pills from Salesforce account to the Zendesk organization action input fields.\nData pills are contained within datatrees, within the App Data section. At an recipe step, the App Data section contains the output from the trigger and every action preceeding this step.\n\nDatatree within a recipe step\nWhen you're configuring a recipe step, all data from the preceeding steps will be available for use in the fields mapping of that step.\n\nMultiple datatrees available when configuring a recipe step\nData types\nData pills can be of the following data types\n\nString\nInteger\nNumber\nDate\nDatetime\nBoolean\nWhen mapping (i.e. assigning data pill to an input field) it is important that they are 'type' compatible. Workato will do default type conversions where it can be done with no ambioguity or loss of information.\n\nType conversions\nCertain data types can be converted from one to the other using formulas. For example, if you wish to convert a text string of numbers into integer type so as to perform arithmetic on it, or if an app expresses a datetime as a string, but you wish to convert it into a proper datetime type.\nThe list of available type conversion formulas are as follows:\n\nto_currency\nto_date\nto_f\nto_i\nto_s\nto_time\n\nAdditional type conversions may be added from time to time - you can check out the formula editor to see if there is the formula you're looking for.\nPreview data\nWorkato will display sample data (fetched from your account) alongside data pills to help better understand the data in your app.\nIn example below, you can see sample data in italics next to the data pills.\n\nOutput datatree for New Salesforce account trigger\nFields mapping\nFields mapping is defined as the assignment of data pills (variables) or absolute values (constants) into action or trigger input fields. This controls the flow of data between apps.\nBy mapping fields from a Salesforce account (from a trigger) to a Zendesk create organization action, you can ensure that the Zendesk organization and Salesforce account have the same data.\nIn every recipe step, you have access to data pills from all the previous steps' and can be used in configuring input fields of current step. In this way, we're crafting a template that determines data flow in your recipe.\nExample\nIn the following example, we map the Account Name data pill from the Salesforce New account trigger into the Message input field in the Send email action.\n\nMapping the account name data pill into the message input field\nMapping constants vs mapping variables\nWorkato input fields can be assigned variables (data pills) or constants (absolute values).\nMapping variables\nThe variable Account name has been mapped to the Name input field. This means that for every new Salesforce account that is created, the account name of this Salesforce account will be used as the organization name of the Zendesk organization that will be created. For example, a new Salesforce account named Sattei Winery will in turn create a Zendesk organization named Sattei Winery.\n\nInput field with variable mapping\nMapping constants\nOn the other hand, the input field Notes has a constant mapped to it - the words \"Synced over from Salesforce.\" This means that all newly created Zendesk organizations created via Workato will have the words \"Synced over from Salesforce.\" in its Notes field.\n\nInput field with constant mapping\nHere's an example of the new Zendesk organization created via the above mapping:\n\nNewly created Zendesk organization Sattei Winery\nMapping both constants and variables\nYou can also combine constants and variables in the input fields for the data you wish to have.\nExample\nLet's take the scenario where we wish to send out a simple welcome email to every new Salesforce lead who has signed up. The recipe looks like\n\nRecipe that sends a welcome email to new Salesforce leads Example recipe\nIn the Send email action, pills from the New Salesforce lead datatree have been mapped into the input fields.\n\nExample of data pills being mapped into an action step\nSince pills are variables, their value will depend on a specific trigger event, or action. In this example, the value assigned to the To input field, will depend on the value of email in each new lead. If a new lead called Madison Diaz with the email address madisondiaz82@gmail.com is created, the recipe will pick it up and promptly send an email to the address madisondiaz82@gmail.com with the message:\nHi Madison,\n\nThanks for joining our mailing list! We're excited to have you!\nData transformation\nData fields from one app may not directly map into a data field for a different apps. For example:\n\nyour sales app stores names in a single field full name, but your marketing app uses two fields first name and last name\nyour ecommerce app stores addresses as individual fields, e.g. address line 1, address line 2, city, state, but your accounting app simply requires a single billing address field\nthe priority levels in your ticketing app may be low, medium, high, but in your sales system they're low, normal, urgent\n\nIn such cases, you can take advantage of Workato's data transformation capabilities by using formulas.\nCommon issues when mapping fields\nHere are some of the common errors we've experienced when it comes to fields mapping\n\nData pills with no values at run-time for required fields\n\nAt design-time (when we're building the recipe), all required fields are supposed to be mapped. The recipe will refuse to start and throw an error if a required field is left empty.\nHowever, even if an input field has been mapped at design-time, it might not actually have a value at run-time (when a trigger event comes in and a job is being processed). In such a case, that specific job will throw an error and fail.\nYou would need to decide how to handle such cases whereby a required field might not receive a value at run-time. If that is rightly a business logic error which needs to be resolved, e.g. the recipe tries to move a new lead from a sales app to a marketing app, but finds that it's missing an email address for the lead, the answer might be to let the job fail and flag the employee who had created the lead record.\n\nData pills from the wrong datatree\n\nWhen mapping input fields with data pills, it is common to find pills with the same names in the datatrees, e.g. if you're moving customers from an app to another, customer datatrees tend to hold address information. Hence you might find yourself using a pill with the right name, e.g. City, State, Country, but from the wrong datatree.\n\nData pills from the wrong part of the recipe\nIf your recipe has conditional steps, e.g. if customer is present, update customer record, and if customer is not present, create customer record, then for each job that's processed, there will be steps that are not carried out. In such cases, the values in the datatree for these steps will most likely be blank.\n\nIf you're using data pills from these steps, you need to recognize the potential of these pills being null, and handle that scenario.\n"},"recipes/version-management.html":{"url":"recipes/version-management.html","title":"Version management","keywords":"","body":"Version management\nEvery time a recipe is saved, a version of the recipe is saved.

Make sure your trigger works as expected\n Things to check when using a trigger :\n\nShould you be using trigger filters?\nIs the Since parameter correct? \nShould it be based on created/updated, or just created?\nI start the recipe with nothing but the trigger followed by a clock action. The clock action is just a dummy action. When I test this recipe, it will get a current time. This way, I can check whether the tested output is the desired result that I wish. I am able to do all this without updating records in any of my connected apps.\n\n\n\n2. Check your conditional actions\n You can now add a few more steps to make sure which condition would be the best choice, I use clock, email, or Slack in place of the real actions to capture the data mappings that will eventually be there..The reason for adding these notification steps here is that conditional steps do not show up in the log, hence we need to add different actions for different conditions to know if the conditions are correct.\n \n Best if you have both sides to know which is the better course to take.\n3. Pay Attention to indentation\n Make sure that your actions are all nested correctly. For Conditional actions and repeated actions, actions that you want to be processed under those criteria have to be nested under the first action. If an action is supposed to be activated under a certain condition, make sure that it is nested under the same scope. If it isn't, it will be processed regardless of the condition.\n  \n This is wrong because Step 2 is not indented. Note how Step 4 is on a different level from the rest. Step 4 is indented under Step 3.\n4. Cloning and Version Control\n  I use cloning and modifying to create the next version of the recipe. Cloning recipe allows me to push changes to the original recipe whenever I want to. This allows you to create a \"test\" and \"production\" recipes. The cloned recipe will be a production recipe, and you can make changes on the original/test recipe. \n![iterative_tip_4_1](/assets/images/building-best-practices/iterative_tip_4_1.png)\n\nWhen you edit the original recipe, the cloned recipe will show that changes are available to be pushed.\n\n![iterative_tip_4_2](/assets/images/building-best-practices/iterative_tip_4_2.png)\n\nSimply click on install to copy the changes from test recipe to production recipe\n Once you are satisfied with the changes, going to the cloned recipe, you should be able to see a note that a new version is available. This allows you to push any changes made on the test recipe to the production recipe. \nVersion Control Guide\nIf you have made any unwanted changes to your recipe and want to revert back to a previous version, just follow this guide!\nFirst, got to the recipe page and look under the Description tab. Under the tab, you should see the current version of the recipe, with the View History link next to it. \n Click on the View History page, and you should see something like this\n  \n Click on a version that you would like to revert to or just take a look at, and you see a page with the details of that version of the recipe.\n   \n Once you are satisfied that this is the version that you want to revert to, click on the  button and voila! You have reverted your recipe to a previous version!\n5. Cleaning up\n I keep iteratively building up the recipe, until I get to my perfect recipe. After I am done, I go and cleanup all the temporary recipes I had built that I don't need any more. To delete, you click on the Delete Button underneath the 'Start Recipe' Button.\n\n6. Try out the new recipe.\nAt this point will connect to the production system by changing the App connection to point to the production app. I will try out the recipe by changing the since parameter to a very short interval, and add a new record and test it out. I may do this step iteratively too, by updating  the test system first and then change the connections to make the updates to the production system.\nThe final step is to make a copy of the recipe and change the since parameter to the right interval. You will need to make a copy of the recipe as changing the since parameter to an earlier time does not trigger the recipe to go back before the latest trigger than was made. You may also need to change the connections to your production systems.\nClick on start to start the recipe. You are done. If there are any errors you will be notified by email. \n7. Monitor\nIf you want to you can monitor the recipe periodically to see if there are any errors that you had not taken care of. You can do this on the 'My recipes page' that shows the active recipes and the failed and successful job counts.\nNaming Your Recipes\nWhen we are in a rush to get our recipe up and running it seems like a chore to pay attention to the name or description for the recipe, but giving it a proper name and describing it properly goes a long way when you have many recipes. Different people have different styles, and we will mention some that we follow\nNaming\n\nUsing the name of the main apps in the recipe name. I used to name them as [SFDC+QBO] New account in Salesforce... I still use this sometime so I can quickly spot them or sort them when I am dealing with them outside the system. I keep a separate log of my recipes in a spreadsheet for my own cataloging purposes and naming it this way sometimes helps\n\nSome people put in their name in front or some other prefix like [RD] New customer from Salesforce.... or [Prod] New customer from Salesforce etc.\n\nTo use the 'New recipe' prefix or not. Some people use the New recipe prefix while they are building the recipe, and when they have a successful recipe, change that to the intended name and delete the trial ones. They can easily track and delete the trial ones because of the 'New recipe' pre-fix.\n\n\nClones\n\nIf you clone a recipe from some other user, your recipe gets the same name as the original. Keep in mind that when the original changes you don't get notified or updated.\n\nCopies\n\nWhen you copy your own recipe, you will get a name that starts with 'Copy of' .... This is to avoid having duplicate names, however it does not really matter to the system because the unique identifier for a recipe is the recipe number. You can see the recipe number in the recipe link. For example, the recipe number for the recipe displayed below is 13582. You can always get to a recipe by keying in the address as www.workato.com/recipes/[recipe number here]. This works for all public recipes, but not for private recipes.\n\n*The URL to search for this recipe would be: www.workato.com/recipes/13582\n\n\nAdding Descriptions and Comments on your Recipes\nRecipe Descriptions\nWe like recipe builders to describe their recipes well. This is because we built Workato as a community for building and sharing recipes and we want to make the recipes easy for sharing. When someone else is looking at your recipe, they will see the definition on top and decide if they want to look further down or not. \nComments\nWe also recommend adding comments to your recipe steps, especially if the steps are not obvious. To attach comments, you click on the comment button, that is the first button on the right hand set of buttons/icons. If you click on it, a Comment window opens up underneath.\n To learn how to add comments and descriptions to your recipes, watch this video.\n"},"recipes/running-recipes.html":{"url":"recipes/running-recipes.html","title":"Running recipes","keywords":"","body":""},"recipes/start-and-stop.html":{"url":"recipes/start-and-stop.html","title":"Start and stop","keywords":"","body":"Starting & stopping recipes\nStarting recipes\nClick on 'Start recipe' to activate the recipe i.e. look for trigger events to process.\nIf you have already run your recipe in 'test' mode, the 'Start recipe' button should be displayed, otherwise, this button is available in the dropdown beside 'Test recipe'.\n\nAfter you have started the recipe, the recipe becomes an 'Active' recipe. On your home page, you can filter by active recipes to see all the active recipes.\nStopping recipes\nStop the recipes when they are no longer relevant, or to make changes. \n\nWhen you start the recipe again, Workato remembers the last processed event, and will start processing from there so you do not miss any trigger events when your recipe was stopped.\nWhy are my recipes automatically stopped?\nThere are 2 reasons for this: \n\nRecipes are automatically stopped when the monthly transaction limit is hit. Contact our customer success team to add more transactions. \n\nThere are more than 60 consecutive errors in receiving trigger events. In this case, address the underlying cause (e.g. API password change, etc.) and restart the recipe.\n\n\n\nRestarting recipes\nStarting a stopped recipe will pick up jobs from where it last stopped. \nFor example, if I stopped my recipe on January 1st, 10:30pm, and start it again on January 10th, 7pm, it will begin picking up jobs from January 1st, 10:31pm onwards. \nIf you wish for the recipe to only start picking up new jobs from January 10th onwards, copy the recipe and change the 'From' date. The 'copy' button is below the recipe name. \n\nNotifications email\nAnytime there is an error when processing a recipe, an email is sent. By default, this email is sent to your Workato account login email. You can change this, or add additional recipients by setting your notifications email in your account settings. \n\n\n"},"recipes/testing-recipes.html":{"url":"recipes/testing-recipes.html","title":"Test mode","keywords":"","body":"Testing recipes\nTesting recipes is a good practice, especially if you are automating complex workflows. Workflows involve moving data between apps, and errors can have serious side effects. Testing recipes ahead of broad usage can save a lot of time in the long run.\nTest mode\nThe 'Test Recipe' button will start the recipe, process only the first trigger event and then stop. So even if there are a lot of trigger events, in the test mode, you can process one at a time. \nSet up trigger event\nWhen in test mode, you will have to make sure that there is a trigger event available for processing. For example, if the trigger is \"New invoice in QuickBooks\", as shown below, there has to an new invoice ready for the tigger to pick up. \n\nTrigger events should be created prior to testing the recipe, and not when the 'Test recipe' button is clicked. \nChange the 'From' parameter for testing\nYou may have to change the'From' parameter in your trigger to ensure that test events that have already been created, can be picked up in the test mode.\n\nFor triggers that do not have the 'From' parameter, only tigger events created after the recipe start will be picked up.\nNote: The 'From' parameter cannot be changed once the recipe has been tested or started. To change the 'From' parameter, simply copy the recipe and modify it in the new copy.\n\nTest results\nAfter clicking on 'Test recipe', check the 'Jobs' tab to see what has run. Any errors that have occurred during the tests will show up in the job report with a red warning logo. \n\nIf there is no red logo, the job is successful. During the testing phase, click on the description to see if the job has completed as expected because the job may have stopped at a conditional stop action as shown below. There might be other steps that were expected to complete. If so, there may be an error in the logic of the recipe that needs fixing.\nFinding the error\nThe step where the error occurred is highlighted with a red line. Click on the step with the error to see details.\n\nIn this case, the error occurs in step 12. Click on the 'Error' tab to see the details.\n \nRerun error jobs\nRe-running jobs are the easiest way to test the recipe after fixing the errors. Check the box next to the job to be rerun and click on the rerun button.\n\nTesting tips\nUse sandbox\nIf the connector supports sandbox accounts, they are recommended for testing recipes. This is to ensure no bad data is entered into the production accounts.\nAdding 'Stops' to prevent unwanted actions from happening\nAdd a 'Stop' to the recipe when testing if the actions that follow are not needed. Click the '+' button below the last step in the recipe and drag it to the correct place.\n\nFor example, if the last step in the recipe updates a record in the application that is not needed, adding a Stop above it will prevent this. This saves time in correcting the data that has changed in the applications.\nTest with all possible scenarios\nRecipes often come with multiple lines of conditional logic (i.e. IF this then that). \nIn these situations, test the recipe with all possible scenarios to ensure the pills are properly mapped and logic properly defined in the recipe. Doing these tests will save time fixing erroneous data after starting your recipe.\n"},"recipes/jobs.html":{"url":"recipes/jobs.html","title":"Jobs","keywords":"","body":"Jobs\nWhen an 'active' recipe processes a trigger event i.e. actions in the recipe are executed, it results in a job. The set and sequence of actions executed depends on the data of the specific trigger event.\nWorkato provides complete details into the execution flow of a job i.e. what steps were executed, and the data input and output from every step.\nWorkato also supports rerunning jobs.\nJob status\nJobs can have the following statuses:\n\nCompleted\nCompleted indicates that the job was processed successfully.\n\nFailed\nFailed indicates that the job ended because of an error. Errors can generally be attributed to failures in executing actions. e.g. an app was not reachable, or a contact being added already exists, etc. A\n\n\nWhen an error is encountered, job execution stops i.e. downstream steps are not executed. \nSuch jobs may create incomplete records in your apps as it failed before finishing all steps.\n\nPending\nPending indicates that the job is still being processed.\n\nAborted\nAborted is a rare state that a job can get into if it has pending jobs and the recipe has been affected in a manner that these pending jobs cannot finish processing. \n\n\nZZZZZZZZ\nJobs report\nThe jobs report is a record of all processed jobs. For each processed job, you can view complete details i.e. execution flow, data input/output from every step.\n\nJobs report page\nYou can find out more about jobs reports here.\nRerun jobs\nAny job (completed, failed, etc.) can be rerun. Workato stores the trigger event, and will rerun a job using this copy of the trigger event. \nRerun of a job will always use the latest version of the recipe. i.e. if the recipe has been modified since the job ran, rerun will use the most recent version.\nYou can find out more about job reruns here.\nZZZZZZZZ\nJobs report\nThe jobs report is a record of all processed jobs. For each processed job, you can view complete details i.e. execution flow, data input/output from every step.\nInformation such as date, time processed and job IDs, can be found here. The following shows the default jobs report page.\n\nNon-customized, default jobs report page\nCustom report\nJobs report can be further customized to show any data available in the recipe. e.g. if processing invoices, your job report can have Invoice ID, Invoice amount, etc.\n\nCustomized jobs report page\nTo create a custom jobs report, click on 'Customize report' next to the Rerun and Refresh buttons.\n\nYou can use data pills from any data tree in your recipe for the column values. In the example below, the custom jobs report contains the Xero invoice ID, Infusionsoft invoice ID, as well as payment and contact information. \n\nJob details\nFrom the jobs report, you can view detailed information about each job as well as step-level information. This is useful in several ways:\n\nDebugging your recipe\nDuring testing, jobs may show up as completed in the jobs report, but they might not be processed in the manner you expect - taking a look at the exact steps processed by the recipe will help in ensuring the recipe is processing jobs in the expected manner.\n\nTroubleshooting your job errors\nIf jobs fail, you can take a look at the run-time data to understand why the job failed at specific step.\n\n\nTo view job details, simply click on the job you are interested in seeing.\n\nHow to read the job report\nThe summary of the job is displayed on top of the job report. This includes the status, description, start and end time, and the recipe version.\n\nFor every action, the input and output data is available.\nIn the image below, in the search step, which uses the specific string \"Xero Invoice + Invoice Number to search for an order title, the input contains the string and the number of the invoice used in this job.\n\nOutput data example\n\nLooking at the output in the steps can tell you vital information about why a job has failed. Often, the output used in a specific step may be empty, thus using the data pills from that step in a later part of the recipe will not yield anything.\nErrors\nWhen the job throws an error, view which step this occurs at and the error details on this page. The step with the error is indicated with a red line.\n\nConditional step\nIn conditional actions, there is only an \"Output\" tab. The output will have one of two values: \"True\" or \"False\" which determines whether the nested actions will take place.\nWhen the value is \"False\", the nested actions will be skipped and the recipe proceeds to the next possible action.\n\nWhen the value is \"True\", the nested actions will be completed.\n\nFor each step\n"},"recipes/rerun-job.html":{"url":"recipes/rerun-job.html","title":"Rerun job","keywords":"","body":"Rerunning Jobs\nWhen do I need to rerun a job?\nRe-running a job will cause the trigger event to be passed through the recipe again, and this feature is useful in the cases below:\n\nTesting a new recipe\nWhen there are errors encountered\n\nNote: Duplicates may occur when jobs are rerun, so be sure to check and remove duplicates (if present) before re-running the job.\nTesting a new recipe\nMany times, during testing, people incrementally build and test a recipe with the same job. During the testing phase, rerunning jobs is commonly used to fix the errors encountered in recipes. \nRather than creating new trigger events, rerunning the same job will allow you to fix the errors 1 step at a time with the same event.\nErrors\nWhen an error is detected in your recipes, an email will be sent to the Notifications email address specified in the Account Settings. The job will be incomplete and data may be missing from the application as certain steps in the recipe were not completed. \nThus, rerunning the job is necessary to ensure the job runs to completion as specified in the recipe.\nYou can view all the errors in the 'Jobs' tab and filtering the report. \n\nNo fixing of the recipe is required\n If you face the following errors, rerun your job and the job should complete: \n\nConnection errors: These are intermittent issues that result from connection issues with the applications connected to the recipe. \n\nErrors that need fixing\nWhen the error is different from the ones listed above, or if rerunning the jobs do not work, the recipe or data from the application needs to be fixed.\nIn the job report, look at the error code provided and make the changes accordingly. \nWhat does rerunning a job do?\nEssentially, rerunning a job uses the same trigger event and runs the job from start to finish. \nNote: As a previously run job may have run through steps that have created objects in the applications, rerunning the job may cause errors as these objects already exist. Thus, ensure that objects created by previously run jobs have been deleted before rerunning.\nHow to rerun a job\nJobs Tab\nNavigate to the 'Jobs' tab and to see a list of jobs that have been run. You can filter the jobs by 'Completed', 'Pending' and 'Failed'. \nCompleted jobs are those that have successfully run through the recipe while failed jobs met with errors that stopped the job before it could be completed. \nCheck the boxes on the left of each line and click 'Rerun'. You can rerun 10 jobs (1 page of jobs) at a time. \n\nJob Report\nThe rerun job button is located on the top right hand corner of the job report page. Click on this to rerun the job and you will be re-directed to the 'Jobs' tab.\n\nRerun History\nAll rerun jobs have a history log at the bottom of the job details page. Click on each line to view the previously run jobs. \n\nData retention policy\nData retention applies to processed trigger events. This means that older jobs might not be able to be reran.

Take note that most formulas will return an error and stop the job if it tries to operate on nulls (expressed as nil in Ruby), except for present?, presence and blank?.\nYou can refer to the complete Ruby documentation for arrays (lists) here as well as the Ruby documentation for hashes here.\nLists (arrays)\nArrays are ordered, integer-indexed collections of any object. List indexing starts at 0. Lists are the same as Ruby arrays, and we will be using lists and arrays interchangeably in this article.\nLet's take the example of a list with 4 list items: 100, 101, 102, 103. This list is expressed as:\nnumber_list = [100, 101, 102, 103]\nAs lists are ordered, we can use the following formula to get the values:\n\n\n\nExample\nResult\n\n\n\n\nnumber_list.first\n100\n\n\nnumber_list.second\n101\n\n\nnumber_list.third\n102\n\n\nnumber_list.fourth\n103\n\n\nnumber_list.last\n103\n\n\n\nWe can also use indexes to get corresponding values. Remember, indexes start at 0:\n\n\n\nExample\nResult\n\n\n\n\nnumber_list[0]\n100\n\n\nnumber_list[1]\n101\n\n\nnumber_list[2]\n102\n\n\nnumber_list[3]\n103\n\n\n\nLists in Ruby supports negative indexes.\n\n\n\nExample\nResult\n\n\n\n\nnumber_list[-1]\n103\n\n\nnumber_list[-2]\n102\n\n\nnumber_list[-3]\n101\n\n\nnumber_list[-4]\n100\n\n\n\nLists also support ranges as indexes. This returns another list, instead of returning only a value.\n\n\n\nExample\nResult\n\n\n\n\nnumber_list[0..2]\n[100, 101, 102]\n\n\nnumber_list[-3..-1]\n[101, 102, 103]\n\n\nnumber_list[0..-2]\n[100, 101, 102]\n\n\n\nHashes\nA hash is a dictionary-like collection of unique keys and their values. They are similar to Lists, but where a List uses integers as its index, a Hash allows you to use any object type. Hashes enumerate their values in the order that the corresponding keys were inserted.\nLet's take the example of a hash with 2 values, with item_name as \"Acme widgets\" and item_quantity as 10.\nline_item = { item_name: “Acme widgets”, item_qty: 10 }\n\n\n\nExample\nResult\n\n\n\n\nline_item[“item_name”]\n\"Acme widgets”\n\n\nline_item[“item_qty”]\n10\n\n\n\nList of hashes\nIn Workato, you will mostly run into lists of hashes. Let’s look at a Quickbooks invoice which has a number of line items.

Workato can act as the intermediary to move files from one app to another, as well as extract data from text files and parse it for use in Workato. For example, a recipe can retrieve CSV file content, parse it and make it available within Workato so it can be transformed and moved to another app.\nSome examples of text files commonly worked with:\n\nTabular data: CSV\nDocuments: txt, rtf\nWeb standards: html, XML, JSON\n\nBinary files\nBinary files refer to any file which is not human readable. Unlike text files where Workato parses the content to understand the structure of data, with binary files, Workato does not interpret the content, e.g. Workato cannot read and interpret an image file, but it can upload the entire file into Salesforce as an attachment.\nSome examples of binary files commonly used:\n\nImages: jpg, png, gif, bmp, psd\nDocuments: pdf, doc, docx, ppt, xls, odt\n\nMoving text/binary files as-is between apps\nWhen moving files across apps without interpreting the content, it works sames for text or binary files. Workato has 2 approaches:\n\nBy passing on a URL to the destination app, so this data does not have to move through Workato. This URL will have to be publicly accessible and can disappear afer the job has completed.\nBy uploading content from app to Workato, and then downloading to the other app. This is not a great approach for working with very large files, as all the data has to move into the recipe, across every recipe step and then to the destination app.\n\nMoving text/binary files via public URL\nThis is typically a 2-step process:\n\nGet the public URL of the file to move. Generally found in the trigger or action output. e.g. New file trigger output contains a URL.\n\nPass in this public URL to the destination app. Generally an Upload file via URL action.\n\n\nExample\nLet's take the scenario where we move new files from Dropbox to Box. This is how the recipe looks.\n\nRecipe moves files from Dropbox to Box via public URLs Example recipe\nThe Obtain a direct URL to file field in the New file trigger should be marked, so as to generate a public URL for the new file. The recipe then verifies that the file does not already exist in Box before uploading the file into Box via URL.\n\nObtain a direct URL for the Box file, then map the URL to the Box file to the upload action Example recipe\nMoving text/binary files via file content\nThis is typically a 2-step process:\n\nDownload the file content of the file to move. Generally found in the datatree output of New file triggers.\n\nPass in this public URL to the destination app. Generally a Upload file via content action.\n\n\nExample of moving text/binary files via file content\nLet's take the scenario where Gmail email attachments need to be moved to Box. This is how the recipe looks.\n\nRecipe moves Gmail attachments to Box Example recipe\nFrom the New email trigger output, each email event that comes in has potentially a list of attachments. Therefore, the conditional action checks if the email has attachments. If not, nothing is processed for that email. In this case, the datapill from the attachment list in New email trigger is used. As the pills within a list refer to the first list item in that list (e.g. the first attachment within the list of attachments) unless when used in a for each step or in an input array, this allows us to verify if there's at least one attachment in the list.\n\nCheck if email contains at least one attachment Example recipe\nIn cases whereby the email event has one or more attachments, the for each step ensures that the recipe iterates through the list of attachments, and that for each attachment, the attachment content is downloaded from Gmail before being uploaded into Box.\n\nIf email contains attachments, download each attachment from Gmail using attachment ID, and upload attachment content to Box Example recipe\nIn this case, file content is used as Gmail does not provide public URLs to attachments. For scenarios where the source app provides public URLs to files and the target app accepts URLs for file uploads, moving of files via URLs should be the preferred method for recipe efficiency.\nExample of using Utilities to download file from public URL\nThe Utilities connector has a Download file from URL action that retrieves file content, given a public URL to a file. In cases whereby the file source app provides only a public URL to the file, but the destination app requires the actual file content, this action can be used.\nLet's take the scenario where new files created in a shared Box folder needs to be uploaded and associated with a Salesforce account. This is how the recipe looks.\n\nRecipe that uses Utilities to download file content Example recipe\nThe recipe uses the public URL to the Box file to download the file content. This file content is then uploaded into Salesforce as a new attachment, associated to a certain Salesforce account (the account ID is hardcoded in this instance).\n\nDownload file using Box URL, then upload file content to Salesforce Example recipe\nBase64 encoding\nBase64 encoding is a way of converting binary content into a set of standard characters for sending over networks. Certain apps require base64-encoded file content to be uploaded, and usually these same apps will produce base64-encoded file content when their files are downloaded.\nWorkato supports the ability to encode or decode base64 content via formulas.\nTo base64 encode binary content and upload it into such apps:\n\nFormula for encoding file content\nTo decode binary content from base64 content from such apps:\n\nFormula for decoding file content\nInterpreting file content and moving to other apps\nWhen working with text files, Workato and interpret the content of the file and convert individual elements to the data tree pills to make it easier to transform and send to other apps.\nExample\nThe following recipe creates a NetSuite inventory object by using data from a CSV file.\n\nRecipe reads CSV file Example recipe\nWhen using Box new CSV file trigger, the expected columns in CSV files has to be declared for Workato to know how the data is structured. From this declaration, Workato builds the trigger output datatree.\n\nDefining the expected columns in the CSV files that the recipe will pick up Example recipe\nThe columns defined in the Box new CSV file trigger shows up as usable data pills in the output datatree.

An example of such a connector is the Box connector. With such connectors, you can simply listen to new CSV files and parse them via the same Workato trigger to move the data into another app.\nExample\nIn the following recipe, the Box trigger New CSV file will be used to read the sample CSV file from a Box folder and parse it to Workato as a list of three CSV lines. To try it out, create a CSV file with the above CSV sample and upload into a specific Box folder for the New CSV file trigger to pick up.\nNote - even if you have CSV files with other schema and different header lines in the selected folder and sub-folders, the New CSV file trigger will pick up those CSV files as well and attempt to process them with the header specified. This may lead to job errors or bad data being moved into your app. Ensure that you're only picking up the files you want by keeping all the relevant CSV files in the monitored folder, or by adding a trigger filter to filter only files to pick up.\nThe following recipe parses new CSV files in Box and uses the data parsed to create new NetSuite inventory items.\n\nRecipe that parses CSV files to retrieve data for use in datatree Example recipe\nWhen using Box new CSV file trigger, the expected columns in CSV files has to be declared for Workato to know how the data is structured. From this declaration, Workato will build the trigger output datatree for use in subsequent actions.\n\nDefining the expected columns in the CSV files that the recipe will pick up Example recipe\nThe columns defined in the Box new CSV file trigger shows up as usable variables in the output datatree. These variables can be used to map into subsequent recipe steps.\n\nUsing the variables created from the columns definition Example recipe\nParsing CSV files via Utility connector's CSV parsing capability\nNot all connectors are able to process CSV files in particular and move individual values from these CSV files into other apps. Such connectors will have triggers that process only files in general. In such cases, we can still try to read the text content of CSV files and parse them explicitly with the Utility connector. This will allow us to move individual values from these CSV files into other apps, for example, from the sample CSV file:\nSierra Gardening\nMS-323\nCherry\nNatural\nExample\nIn the following recipe, Dropbox files triggered upon are not being parsed in the trigger, hence the additional need to download the content of the file and parse the CSV content for Workato to use. Parsing the CSV lines provides us with a list of lines (with each line having their own set of inventory item values) to utlize, hence we use a Repeat step to iterate through the list of lines and to create an inventory item with each set of values.\n\nExample recipe\nIn the Parse CSV action, provide the file content to the CSV body input field, and specify the header line.\n\nField mapping for the Parse CSV action\nThe header line specified tells Workato how your CSV file's data looks. In this case, we can parse the following line into the proper variables datapill, such that \"Sierra Gardening\" corresponds to \"Manufacturer\", \"MS-322\" corresponds to \"Model\", etc.\nSierra Gardening, MS-322, Gardening supplies, Cherry wood potting bench, MS-322, Oakwood potting bench, 74.50, 119.99, Yes, 0.0875, Cherry, Natural, 30 inches\nThe Parse CSV action's datatree returns a list of CSV lines.\n\nOutput datatree for Parse CSV action showing the variables defined in the header line\nIn order to iterate through this list of CSV lines, we have to use a Repeat step.

It is an extension of the Workato framework. It supports a variety of authentication procedures and allows developers to easily build, maintain and distribute connectors to integration-seekers. The Workato SDK is not just a framework to serve external developers. Many of the existing Application connectors on the Workato platform are built on top of this framework.

The scheduler (aka clock) connector supports such use cases.\nThe scheduler connectors supports two types of triggers:\n\nNew scheduled event: This trigger can be configured to fire periodically. The user can select from every 5 minutes to days and weeks.\nNew scheduled event (advanced): This trigger can be configured to fire at a specific time, and specific frequency. e.g. 1:15pm every Monday and Tuesday.\n\nIt is important to note that all times are in the user's time zone. The user's time zone setting is defaulted to the locale from which they sign up to Workato. The timezone setting can be modified (in the user settings section) at any time. All new jobs will then use the new time zone setting.\nThe following 2 actions are also supported:\n\nGet current time - returns the specific time when this step is executed within in a job. \nWait - The job waits for the specified amount of time before executing the next step in the recipe. \n\nTriggers\nNew scheduled event\nThis triggers at regular time intervals based on the user configuration. You can select from as low as 5 minutes to weeks. Specify the time interval at when you would like the recipe to run.\nYou can also set the time you want the recipe to start running using \"Start at\". e.g. Start running this recipe at 4:00 pm on Friday the 13th of August, and from then on run it every 15 minutes.\nNew scheduled event (advanced)\nThis trigger will run the recipe at specific times.

Batch processing triggers allow processing a group of trigger events at a time i.e. a group of events, results in a job. The group size is usually configurable with typical values between 1 and 500 depending on the app.\nBatch processing can provide higher throuhput when you are moving large number of records from one app to another. To get high throughput you want to match batch triggers with batch actions.\nBatch processing triggers and actions are supported in certain connectors, such as database connectors (SQL Server, MySQL, etc.), cloud storage connectors that works with CSV files (e.g. Box, Amazon S3), Salesforce connector, etc.\nBatch triggers\nBatch triggers are similar to polling triggers in fetching trigger events. However, where polling triggers have trigger events corresponding to a single record, batch triggers have trigger events corresponding to a list of records. Maximum batch size can usually be defined in the trigger configuration.\nEach poll will fetch up to the maximum batch size specified. When less records are available, the trigger event will have less records.\nThis group of records is made available as a list within the job.\nBatch trigger example\nThe Salesforce batch trigger has a default value of 100. In this case, each trigger event will contain a maximum 100 account records. \n\nBatch trigger with a batch size of 100\nThe job details for each trigger event will contain the specific details of only the first and last record in the list.\n\nJob details - trigger output for a batch of new accounts in Salesforce\n For example, when the following recipe was first started, 843 records were fetched from 1 Jan 2015, midnight PST. These records were broken up into 8 trigger events of 100 records each, and 1 trigger event of 43 records. The next poll, 5 minutes later, fetched only 2 new account records created.\n\nCustom job report displaying account batches' details - names of first and last accounts in the batch, as well as batch size\nBatch actions\nBatch actions are typically of the form Create batch or Update batch or Upsert batch. Accordingly, these actions create a list of new records, update a list of existing records, or upsert (create if record doesn't exist, update if record exists) a list of records.\nBatch create actions\nBatch create actions create multiple records in a single action (typically corresponding to a single API call). Batch create actions usually accept a list of records as input, therefore typically recipes will:\n\nmove a list of records from source app to target app, or\nprepare a list of records via building and accumulating data in a custom list, then moving that prepared list into the target app\n\nBatch create action example\nThe following is an example scenario that imports new products from a Box CSV file into Salesforce via the Bulk insert action.\n\nExample recipe using list input Example recipe\nActions that take lists as inputs will have a input field called Source list, which will only take in list pills. When these list input fields are selected, the datatree changes to offer only list pills. The Rows list object pill is mapped into the Salesforce product source list input field.\n\nRows list object is mapped into the Salesforce products input source list\nFor the list object passed into the input source list, the list will be transferred from the source app to the target app, with the values being trasnferred based on the fields mapped in the recipe. The three inventory items will be moved from Box into Salesforce as products.\n\nMapping of list datapills to list input\nThe following shows the CSV file content.\n\nTrigger output details displaying lines within the CSV file\nThe action output in the job history shows that three products have been created accordingly in Salesforce.\n\nSalesforce bulk insert via list input\n"},"features/lookup-tables.html":{"url":"features/lookup-tables.html","title":"Lookup tables","keywords":"","body":"Lookup tables\nThe primary reason for lookup tables (also termed as cross reference tables) is to enable fast and easy lookup of frequently used data that are static and immutable. \nSome of examples of such data include:\n\nGiven a city name, you want to get the zip code \nConversion from metric to SI for distances \nGiven a department, rank, retrieve vacation accrual rate\n\nLookup tables is currently only available to Business plans and up.\nLimits\nYou cannot have more than 5000 entries in one lookup table\nWe support only 5 columns. Each column can be used as a key to lookup the entry\nHow to setup your lookup tables\nThere are two ways your recipes can upload data from your lookup tables:\n\nBy importing an existing CSV file \nBy adding new entries via a recipe\n\nNote: Lookup tables are immutable and the existing entries cannot be modified or deleted.\nImporting an existing CSV file\nThe GIF below walks you through the process of creating a lookup table and loading it with data imported from a CSV file.\n\nYou can also manually enter additional rows from the UI.\n\n\nYou can select what columns you choose to view. At present we support only 5 columns.\n\nAdding new entries via a recipe\nThere is a special connector called ‘Lookup table’ that allows you to work with your tables. This connectors support these actions\n\nLookup entry\nSearch entries\nAdd entry\n\n1. Lookup entry\nAs the name suggests, data is typically organized like in a database table columns and rows of data. You can then lookup any row by one or more columns. You can lookup an entry within the specified lookup table by using\n\nAny column\nMultiple columns\nIn the example below, all 4 available columns are displayed. It returns the first entry based on the column value provide. \n\n\nThis GIF walks you through the entire flow:\n\n2. Search entries\nWorks similar to lookup, except that it will return all matched entries. It returns a list.\n3. Add entry\nAdd a new entry to an existing lookup table. Great for reading a data source and creating a lookup table based on it. E.g. read titles from your HR apps and create a title lookup table.\n\nHow to use Lookup Table Formulas\nNow that you have a lookup table set up, you need to configure your recipe to obtain data from one column of the table when data from another column is fed in. To do so, simply use the lookup formula. Simply set any field to formula mode, and enter the formula in this format: \nlookup(table name,column name for search: data pill)[column name for result]\nFor an example you can take a look at the gif below. \n\nAlternatively, you can use the Lookup table connector and use either the lookup entry action to get a single entry or the Search entries action to get an array of results. This would allow you to use data from all the columns in your table for mapping in subsequent steps.\n"},"features/callable-recipes.html":{"url":"features/callable-recipes.html","title":"Callable recipes","keywords":"","body":"Callable Recipes\nCallable recipes are a type of recipe that can be called from another recipe. It's a way to decompose your recipes into smaller recipes, to help simplify as well as enable reuse (i.e. callable recipe can be called from multiple recipes)\nUnlike other recipes that are started by a trigger event, callable recipe steps are executed when the recipe is called from another recipe. \nCallable recipes can also be accessed via REST API.\nAdvantages of using callable recipes\n\nEasier to test\nBy using a single block/loop in a separate recipe instead of repeating the single block/loop multiple times within a recipe, you just have to change the code in one place and test it instead of multiple places in the recipe.\n\nMaking recipes more readable\nInstead of having really long recipes, break it out into smaller recipes that can be called\n\nSharing across recipes\nIf you have a standard error notification policy, you can create a recipe and then have all recipes call this recipe for error notification\n\nSharing across accounts and with business partners\nYou can expose REST APIs to your business partners. e.g. a REST API that provides inventory status to your suppliers. \n\n\nUsing callable recipes\nLet’s take a look at an example to see how this works. Say you want to automate the process of creating an invoice in Quickbooks Online (QBO) when an opportunity is closed-won in Salesforce. The recipe logic would be\nCreate a new customer if customer does not exist\nIn order to create a QBO invoice, you’ll need to create a new customer if the customer does not already exist in QBO. Now, this snippet of logic: “creating a customer in QBO when they don’t already exist,” is a process that is necessary not only with your Salesforce to QBO integrations, but also when you have Point Of Sale (POS) transactions flowing into QBO, invoices you receive from your vendors and more. Instead of recreating the logic for “creating a customer in QBO when they don’t already exist,” you can make this snippet of logic into a Callable Recipe.\nStep 1. Create a new recipe\nCreate a recipe as you normally would, and for the trigger, select Callable Recipe under the application picklist. \n\nFill in a Name for the recipe, and fill up the Input Schema and the Response Schema in the JSON Format. You can find out more about JSON in this link (https://support.workato.com/support/solutions/articles/1000234879-schema-definition) here. \n\nIn simple terms, the input schema determines what fields will be shown and need to be filled in when a callable recipe action is created in the calling recipe. The Response schema determines what pills will be available for use in the calling recipes Output data. \nLastly, you may choose to enable REST endpoint for your recipe. This defaults to No\n[\nNext, create your set of actions for the recipe. For this example you would create a set of standard de-duplication stpes, Run a search, and if search gives no results, create a customer, if exisiting customer found, update customer. For a sample recipe, click here https://www.workato.com/recipes/485991\nStep 2: Call recipe\nCreate a recipe that requires the logic from the callable recipe we created earlier. Set up the trigger as required, and when created the actions you need. When you need to call the callable recipe, simply click on Add a new step, select call recipe, choose the recipe you created earlier, and you will see the fields from your input schema appear. Simply drag and drop the required pills and you'll be good to go! \n\nCalling Recipes from Other Apps with REST API\nEnabling a REST endpoint for recipes makes it available to be called by any application, internal or external, as long as they have the API token to do so. The token ensures the security of your API. Choosing to build simple web and mobile apps using Workato and a REST Endpoint takes out a majority of the custom coding that would be involved and ensures a fast turnaround. There are two ways you can use a REST Endpoint:\n\nBring Information Into An App\nYou can connect any app that has an API available with a REST Endpoint even if Workato doesn’t have a connector for that app. For example, if you want to bring in information from Zillow.com so you know how much a real estate property is worth, you can create a REST Endpoint that will populate your fields in QuickBase every time an employee run the recipe.You can also create a button that will start the REST Endpoint recipe. You can place the button wherever you would like, for example inside of Salesforce, so employees can tell the recipe to run without logging into Workato.\n\nSend Information Out Of An App\nAnother scenario where this is useful is monitoring a supply chain – you could have a business partner call upon the REST endpoint you created to track shipping or generate a report via a link on your internal website. You can embed this anywhere you want.\n\n\nTo manage the REST endpoints and the API tokens, go to “Service Catalog” under your username on the right hand corner of the screen. Here, you can easily test your REST endpoints and find the specific URL used to call the REST API. These screenshots will show you a more detailed view of REST API management:\n"},"features/account-properties.html":{"url":"features/account-properties.html","title":"Account properties","keywords":"","body":"Account properties\nProperties allow you to store account wide recipe configuration parameters.

To do so, you can use the  Create list action to create a list with a predetermined size (up to 500) to use the repeat action. \nFirst, create the create list action, and determine the size you want to use \nNext, you can create a repeat action any time after the Create list action. Then, use the list pill from the create list step's output in the Input list field. Once you have configured your recipe, it will repeat the set of actions the same number of times as the size of the list.\nDownload file from URL\nDownloading a file in a recipe allows you to use that file later in the recipe, usually to upload onto another app. However, downloaded text content can be used directly into the recipe. Downloading a file does not mean that you will see that file on your computer. It is merely download for use in a recipe. Take note the maximum file size you can download is 25MB. \nIn the Download file from URL section, you can provide a static URL if you intend to upload the same file to multiple places, (e.g. as an attachment to all Accounts in Salesforce) or provide a dynamic URL by using a URL pill obtained from a previous step output.

There is a list to read from with the Box connector's New CSV file trigger, but no list processing capabilities in the NetSuite connector's Add inventory item action.\nIn order to move through the list and create three NetSuite inventory items, the Repeat step should be used to iterate through the list, and carry out the same action for each iteration.\n Example recipe\nTo iterate through the Rows list, pass the Rows list object as input for the repeat step. The recipe will therefore iterate through the list thrice to repeat the \"Add inventory item\" action thrice, with different values from different CSV lines each time.\n\nProvide the list object as input for repeat step\nWhen using the Repeat step, the important thing to note is to retrieve datapills from the For each datatree.\n\nMapping datapills from the Foreach datatree\nThis ensures that, when the list is being iterated through, the first Add inventory item step uses the first line:\nSierra Gardening, MS-321, Gardening supplies, Pine wood potting bench, MS-321, Oakwood potting bench, 74.50, 119.99, Yes, 0.0875, Pine, White, 30 inches\nThe second Add inventory item step uses the second line:\nSierra Gardening, MS-322, Gardening supplies, Cherry wood potting bench, MS-322, Oakwood potting bench, 74.50, 119.99, Yes, 0.0875, Cherry, Natural, 30 inches\nAnd the third Add inventory item step uses the third line:\nSierra Gardening, MS-323, Gardening supplies, Cedar wood potting bench, MS-323, Oakwood potting bench, 74.50, 119.99, Yes, 0.0875, Cedar, Black, 30 inches\nCommon mistake when using Repeat step\nAs discussed here, using pills directly from the list object in the datatree without list handling will result in the first list item being used. Hence, if datapills from the list object (instead of datapills from the Repeat step) are used inside the Repeat step, the recipe still iterates through the 3 CSV lines, but instead of using values from each line with every iteration, only values from the first line will be used for all 3 iterations, resulting in duplication.\n\nExample of a recipe with wrong direct mapping from list instead of from the Repeat step (Example recipe)\nList connector (Accumulator)\nThe list connector is a Workato utility built for users to create custom lists and store data in the list for the duration of a job, to be used in the same job. It is usually used for users to prepare a list to write to an action with a list input.\nUsing the accumulator action to create a custom list\nDefining the list fields\nA custom list has to be created before data can be accumulated and stored within it. To create the list, select the List connector and its default action \nAppend item to list.\n\nAccumulator with no fields configured\nDefine the fields in the custom list by configuring field name, type and hint.\n\nAdding a string field to the accumulator list\n\nAdding a date field to the accumulator list\nAfter configuring the fields in the custom list, ensure that the list is within a Repeat step and that the datapills are mapped from the Repeat step's output datatree. This ensures that the iterated list items' values are mapped into the custom list accordingly, and that values are not being duplicated within the list because the wrong pills from the main datatree (as opposed to the Repeat step's datatree) were mapped as shown above.\n\nConfigured and mapped accumulator\nFields can be added or edited within custom lists anytime.\n\nFields can be added or edited in custom lists\nThe custom list can also be edited via its JSON representation.\n\nEditing the custom list's JSON representation\nExample recipes that use accumulator, list input and Repeat step\nLet's take the scenario whereby closed won Salesforce opportunities with a list of opportunity products need to be moved into NetSuite as sales orders with a similar list of line items.\nThe NetSuite connector's Create sales order action takes in a list of line items that reference the inventory items' internal NetSuite ID. This means that users similarly need to have a list of NetSuite inventory item IDs to create the NetSuite sales order in a single action. However, from Salesforce, only Salesforce opportunity products' IDs are available. In order to obtain the NetSuite inventory items' internal IDs, users would have to search for the correct NetSuite inventory item by its Salesforce opportunity product name, and then pass the NetSuite internal ID of the found NetSuite inventory item into the Create sales order action.\nThere are two ways of building this recipe:\n1) Using accumulator + list input. Iteratively build a custom list of NetSuite inventory items from the Saleforce opportunity product list, then create the complete NetSuite sales order with lines in a single action\nIterate through the Salesforce list of opportunity products via a Repeat step to find corresponding NetSuite inventory items, and accumulate that in a custom list. Subsequently, create a complete NetSuite sales order with a list of line items in a single action, by passing in the custom list built with accumulator.\n\nSalesforce-Netsuite recipe using Repeat step Example recipe\n2) Using Repeat step. Create a NetSuite sales order, then iteratively move lines from Salesforce opportunity to NetSuite sales order via a Repeat step.\nFirst, create a NetSuite sales order. Then, in a Repeat step, search for Netsuite inventory item by Salesforce opportunity product name (or any other identifying field). Pass the internal ID of the NetSuite inventory item found into the Update sales order action in order to append a new line to the sales order.\n\nSalesforce-Netsuite recipe using Repeat step Example recipe\n"},"data-retention.html":{"url":"data-retention.html","title":"Data retention","keywords":"","body":"Data retention\nWorkato retains data on the Workato platform for variable periods of time, depending on the Workato plan.\nThis time period is configurable for certain Workato plans.

Each Connector has one or more trigger and actions. When an action or trigger is executed, it performs it's respective function with the account instance connected to that application.\nConnectors built on the SDK are called Custom Connectors. These connectors have private scope. This means that they are only available to the connector owner.\nRecipe\nA Workato recipe is a set of predefined instructions to be executed. It is made up of a trigger and one or more actions to one or more connectors.\nIt execute a variety of tasks to all the applications supported by the Workato platform.\nTrigger\nDefines an event that triggers the execution of a Workato recipe\nAction\nSteps that will be executed when a recipe is triggered.\nThere are 4 types of actions:\n\nAction\nBasic actions perform tasks like Search, Create, Update\n\n\nConditional action\nThese actions behave like traffic control. They provide users with the capability to restrict certain actions based on conditions.\nExample: Create a new Account only if it does not already exist\n\n\nRepeat action\nRepeat actions are simple loops. They perform predefined tasks multiple times based on an array (list) of records.\nExample: Add line items in QuickBooks for each opportunity item in Salesforce\n\n\nStop\nAllows users to terminate a run of the recipe (a job). This is useful if you wish to stop performing any actions if a certain condition is met.\nOptionally, you can define an error for this action. What this does is let you generate exceptions in certain scenarios. These jobs that stops with errors will show up in job history as errors\n\n\n\nFormat\nPresently, we support the following types\n\nJSON\nXML\nwww-form-urlencoded\nmultipart-form\n\nPagination\nPagination helps with response data that is more manageable. It is definitely a bonus if the intended API supports that.\nQuery\nIt is very useful to be able to query resources instead of locating them based on IDs. With Search by query, the API allows you to return a list of results that matches your field criterias. You may also want to look out for the ability to query based on created/updated time which will be crucial when building out your triggers.\nCustom connector sharing\nThere are 3 modes of using a custom SDK based connector\n\nPrivate connector\nShared connector \nPublic connector\n\nPrivate connector\nWhen you create a SDK based connector, by default, it is available only in your account. i.e. it is private.\nShared connector\nSDK based connectors can be shared on an account by account basis i.e. as owner of shared connector you can allow specific accounts to use the connector.\nPlease note, sharing is achieved by copying, i.e. each account you share the connector will have their own copy that they can modify.\nInstall\nWhen copying a recipe that uses a private connector, the user will be asked to obtain a share link for the connector. As the connector owner you can choose to share this link. If you do, you can mail the share link. The end user can click through this link to install the connector to their account. \nThis creates a copy of the connector.\nUpgrade\nWhen you make a change to the connector, the end user will see an upgrade link. They can choose to upgrade their installed connector by clicking through the link.\nUpgrade will overwrite any changes made by end user.\nPublic connector\nTo enable global scope for your private connector, the code will need to submitted to Workato for review. Workato will usually approve or request for modifications within a few days. \nYou can begin this process by submitting a pull request to our repository.\n"},"developing-connectors/sdk/walk-through.html":{"url":"developing-connectors/sdk/walk-through.html","title":"Walk through","keywords":"","body":"Connector SDK Basics\nThis chapter provides a step-by-step walk through of building your own custom connector. Less common features are not included here. For details and examples, navigate to the respective chapters.\nMaking requests\nThe custom connector framework supports building connectors to applications that offer an API reachable over HTTP/HTTPS.  The common request/response formats are supported: JSON (default), XML, and www-form-urlencoded.\nIn parts of the connector that need to make requests, the HTTP verbs (GET, POST etc) are supported as ruby methods.  Let's use an example of an API that uses simple token-based authentication passed as a URL parameter, and returns customer records wrapped in a superfluous customer JSON object that we want the connector to peel off as it's not useful to recipe authors using it:\nGET https://api.my-app.com/v1/customers.json?id=1234&api_token=xyz\n{\n  \"customer\": {\n    \"id\": 1234,\n    \"name\": \"John Smith\",\n    \"email\": \"john.smith@email.com\",\n    \"address\": {\n      \"street\": \"123 Main St\",\n      \"city\": \"Anytown\",\n      \"state\": \"CA\",\n      \"zip\": \"94321\",\n      \"country\": \"USA\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nA request to do the above could be written in a custom connector as:\nget('https://api.my-app.com/v1/customers.json?id=1234&api_token=xyz')['customer']\n\nor\nget('https://api.my-app.com/v1/customers.json').params(id: 1234, api_token: 'xyz')['customer']\n\nRequest execution\nLet's dissect the different parts of the second form of the request above:\nget('https://api.my-app.com/v1/customers.json').params(id: 1234, api_token: 'xyz')['customer']\n\nThis chains three method calls:\n\nCreate the base request.\nMix in more request options.\nAccess the response, at which point the request is lazy-executed.\n\nBase request\nGET https://api.my-app.com/v1/customers.json\nget('https://api.my-app.com/v1/customers.json')\n\nNo request has been made yet: The result so far is the cued-up request for the base URL, and with the request and expected response format set to the default, JSON.\nMix in request options\nid=1234&api_token=xyz\nparams(id: 1234, api_token: 'xyz')\n\nparams is one of the methods available on the request object, adding URL parameters, which are passed as a hash object.  More methods can be similarly chained to mix in other aspects of the request that is to be made:\n\npayload\nPayload fields (PATCH, POST, PUT only), also passed as a hash.\n\nheaders\nRequest headers, passed as a hash\n\nMethods to change the request/response (or both) formats from the JSON default:\nrequest_format_json, response_format_json, format_json, request_format_xml, response_format_xml, format_xml, request_format_www_form_urlencoded\n\nHTTP authentication\nuser, password\n\n\nExecute request and process the response\n  ['customer']\n\nBy calling any method ([] here) that is not a request option, the connector signals that it is time to make the request so that we can process the API response.  In this JSON default case, the response is parsed into a ruby hash:\n{\n  \"customer\" => {\n    \"id\" => 1234,\n    \"name\" => \"John Smith\",\n    \"email\" => \"john.smith@email.com\",\n    \"address\" => {\n      \"street\" => \"123 Main St\",\n      \"city\" => \"Anytown\",\n      \"state\" => \"CA\",\n      \"zip\" => \"94321\",\n      \"country\" => \"USA\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nWhich then has the ['customer'] method evaluated on it, peeling off the customer envelope and resulting in the action's output:\n{\n  \"id\" => 1234,\n  \"name\" => \"John Smith\",\n  \"email\" => \"john.smith@email.com\",\n    \"address\" => {\n      \"street\" => \"123 Main St\",\n      \"city\" => \"Anytown\",\n      \"state\" => \"CA\",\n      \"zip\" => \"94321\",\n      \"country\" => \"USA\"\n    }\n}\n\nSchema - describing input/output\nThere are several components where the connector needs to describe the expected fields for input, output or configuration.  This is done using schema notation:\n[\n  { name: \"id\", type: :integer },\n  { name: \"name\" },\n  { name: \"email\" },\n  {\n    name: \"address\",\n    type: :object,\n    properties: [\n      { name: \"street\" },\n      { name: \"city\" },\n      { name: \"zip\" },\n      { name: \"country\" }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n\nConnector components\nWith these basics out of the way, we can now walk through an example connector, and show how its various parts relate to how users will edit and run recipes.\n{\n  title: 'My sample connector',\n\n  connection: {\n\nConnection fields\nThe optional connection fields use the schema notation to describe the connection configuration fields, if any are needed.  Using the example API above that requires an api_token URL parameter, this might be:\n    fields: [\n      {\n        name: 'api_token',\n        label: 'API token',\n        optional: false,\n        hint: 'You can find your MyApp API token under \"Account Settings\"'\n      }\n    ],\n\nuse the schema notation to describe the connection's properties, shown wherever the connection configuration is displayed, for example in the recipe's connection tab:\n\nAuthorization\nconnection can optionally also contain an authorization component to consolidate the API's authorization logic.  authorization can contain several components, its most important one being apply, which lets us define request options that will be added to any API request made by the connector:\n    authorization: {\n      apply: lambda do |connection|\n        params(api_token: connection['api_token'])\n      end\n    },\n\nThis way our requests don't need to repeat the authorization options:\nget('https://api.my-app.com/v1/customers.json').params(id: 1234)['customer']\n\nConnection test\nBack outside connection, the test component lets the connection be tested, e.g. to make sure the credentials, like api_token in this example, are still valid.\n  },\n\n  test: lambda do |connection|\n    get('https://api.my-app.com/v1/customers.json').params(limit: 1)\n  end,\n\nAs long as the lambda does not raise an exception, the connection is considered live.  It is invoked:\n\nWith non-OAuth connectors only: when the Connect button is clicked.\n\nIn all cases:  When starting a recipe, each connection used in it has the corresponding test called; starting the recipe fails if any test raises an error.\n\n\nActions\n  actions: {\n    get_customer_by_id: {\n\nInput form\nWhen one of the connector's actions is used in a recipe, its input form is based on its input_fields lambda, which also uses the schema notation.\nContinuing with our \"get customer by ID\" action example:\n      input_fields: lambda do\n        [\n          { name: 'id', type: :integer, optional: false }\n        ]\n      end,\n\n\nOutput tree\nUsing the same schema notation, output_fields describes the action's output that will appear downstream in the recipe job data:\n      output_fields: lambda do\n        [\n          { name: \"id\", type: :integer },\n          { name: \"name\" },\n          { name: \"email\" },\n          {\n            name: \"address\",\n            type: :object,\n            properties: [\n              { name: \"street\" },\n              { name: \"city\" },\n              { name: \"zip\" },\n              { name: \"country\" }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      end,\n\n\nexecute\nAt runtime, when the job reaches a recipe line that uses this action, its execute lambda is called.\n\nThe first argument is the connection fields, packaged in a hash object.\n\nThe second argument is the action's input, evaluated based on how the input form is configured in the recipe.  Also packaged as a hash object.\n\n\nAs discussed earlier, the execute lambda makes the request.  The result, lazy-evaluated either within the lambda or right after it returns, is expected to contain the specified output fields.\n      execute: lambda do |connection, input|\n        get('https://api.my-app.com/v1/customers.json').params(id: input['id'])['customer']\n      end\n\n    } # get_customer_by_id\n  }, # actions:\n\nTriggers\n  triggers: {\n    new_customer: {\n\nInput form\nSame as the one for actions\nOutput tree\nSimilar to actions, but describes what each one of the collection of records that the trigger's poll (see below) contains.\nPolling for trigger events\nThere are two types of trigger, to cater to two common patterns in such API endpoints: \"Ascending\" (the default), and \"paging\", a.k.a. descending.\n\"Ascending\" endpoints\nThese are API endpoints that list records in the same order as we would want them consumed.  This is typically ascending in creation or modification time.\nGET /v1/customers.json?created_since=2017-01-01T12:00:00Z&order=asc&limit=100\n{\n  \"customers\": [\n     {\n       id: 1234,\n       created_at: \"2017-01-02T12:34:56Z\",\n       ...\n     },\n     ...

Use this to maintain a \"cursor\" for the next request.\ncan_poll_more\nA flag that informs the runtime whether more results may be immediately available.  If true, a further poll will be made (almost) immediately.\ndedup\n      dedup: lambda do |customer|\n        customer['id']\n      end,\n    }, # closing out the trigger\n\nIt is not always possible to prevent the same record from appearing in separate poll invocations.  To avoid duplicate recipe jobs, the runtime uses dedup, passing it each item returned in events.  The output is a unique identifier associated with the recipe job that results from that item.\nFor triggers that track the creation of new objects, the unique identifier is typically the application-specific unique ID for that object.\nAnother common trigger pattern is tracking object modification.  To reflect that, the connector would typically mix the object's modification timestamp into the event's unique ID:\n\"#{customer['id']}@#{customer['modified_at']}\"\n\n\"Descending\" endpoints\nThese are endpoints that list records in the opposite order from the one we want them consumed.\nGET /v1/customers.json?created_since=2017-01-01T12:00:00Z&created_before=2017-01-21T00:00:00Z&order=desc&limit=100\n{\n  \"customers\": [\n     {\n       id: 9876,\n       created_at: \"2017-01-20T12:34:56Z\",\n       ...\n     }\n     ...

At that point the runtime handles creating the recipe jobs in the \"correct\" order.\n    new_customer_descending: {\n      type: :paging_desc, # marks this as a \"descending\" trigger\n\n      poll: lambda do |connection, input, last_created_before|\n        created_before = last_created_before || Time.now\n        customers = get('https://api.my-app.com/v1/customers.json').\n                      params(created_since: input['created_since'].iso8601,\n                             created_before: created_before.iso8601,\n                             order: 'desc',\n                             limit: 100)['customers'] || []\n        {\n          events: customers,\n          next_page: (customers.length >= 100 && customers.last['created_at']).presence\n        }\n      end,\n\nThis trigger variant's poll response contains two parts:\nevents\nSimilar to the ascending variant's events, but expected to be in descending order.\nnext_page\nIf present (not nil), this signals the runtime that there may be more, \"earlier\", events available in the endpoint.\nThis value will be passed to the next poll as the third argument, named last_created_before in this example.\nIn comparison with the ascending trigger variant, this value plays the roles of both the \"cursor\" (next_poll) and poll timing hint (can_poll_more).\nThe connector doesn't need to keep track of how far we can go before we encounter already-seen events; the runtime handles that state, in combination with the rest of the descending trigger components:\ndocument_id\n      document_id: lambda do |customer|\n        customer['id']\n      end,\n\nExtracts the unique ID of the underlying object.  This is optional, if absent then the default behavior is to use the field called id (case insensitive) in the object (the example above just illustrates the default).\nNote: This is not the same as dedup below.\nsort_by\n      sort_by: lambda do |customer|\n        customer['created_at']\n      end,\n\nExtracts a sorting/ranking value for the underlying object, so the runtime can determine whether we have polled \"far enough\" backwards.\ndedup\n      dedup: lambda do |customer|\n        \"#{customer['id']}@#{customer['created_at']}\"\n      end\n    }, # closing out the trigger\n\nPerforms the same de-duplication logic as in the case of ascending triggers.  However in the case of descending triggers it is optional; example above is the default, of combining the result of document_id and sort_by, separated by a @ character.\nComplete connector\nAt this point, after closing the remaining \"open\" braces in the connector description:\n  } # triggers\n} # top-level connector hash\n\nThe connector should be ready to be used.\n"},"developing-connectors/sdk/authentication.html":{"url":"developing-connectors/sdk/authentication.html","title":"Authentication","keywords":"","body":"Authentication\n\nBasic Authentication\nOAuth 2.0\nCustom Authentication\nTest\n\n"},"developing-connectors/sdk/authentication/basic-authentication.html":{"url":"developing-connectors/sdk/authentication/basic-authentication.html","title":"Basic auth","keywords":"","body":"Basic Authentication\nStandard\nTypically, a basic authentication requires a username and password combination when making requests.

Instead, they return a 200 (pseudo successful response) with a payload that signals the error.\nFor such APIs, an error (expired credentials, bad requests etc.) will not be picked up since it is interpreted as a successful request (Status code 200). A match with the signals defined here will raise an error.\nWhen there is a match here, two things can happen.\nFirstly, there can also be a match against refresh_on signals. When that happens, a re-authorization is triggered (acquire block is executed) instead of raising an error. In this case, detect_on is used to match errors hidden behind responses with status code 200, then used to identify that a credentials refresh is required.\nIf a match here does not match any of the signals defined in refresh_on, an error will be raised.\ndetect_on: [\n  \"sample error message\",\n  /^\\{\"response\":\\{\"error\".+$/\n]\n\nThe example here shows multiple ways that we can define \"signals\" to watch\n\n\"sample error message\": The exact string matching the whole body of response\n/^\\{\"response\":\\{\"error\".+$/: Regex matching the body of response\n\nThis list is optional.

A poll trigger constantly executes a poll block for new events at fixed time intervals. This time interval depends on a user's subscription (5 or 10 minutes). At the same time, it is also able to support pagination. This is useful to prevent request timeouts when making requests with large response results. A trigger can execute immediate consecutive polls to retrieve events from successive pages.\nThere are two types of trigger. The classic trigger type is used by default if type is not specified. The other type is called the \"paging_desc\" trigger, which can be used only for endpoints that provide events sorted in descending order. This trigger type has an auto-paging mechanism that lets you build a simple and efficient trigger. (described in detail below)\nA ruby hash is returned in each poll. This hash should contain a few keys. The array of events, or data, should be passed into the events key. At the same time, a cursor is saved in next_page/next_poll (depending on the trigger type). This cursor provides information about where the current poll stopped, and used in the next poll. A classic type trigger has an additional key can_poll_more, which can be defined to conditionally fire immediate polls for multi-page results.\nClassic Trigger\nNo need to define any type to use the classic trigger. This type is usually used for APIs that only return responses sorted in ascending order.\nupdated_ticket: {\n  input_fields: lambda do\n    [\n      {\n        name: 'since',\n        type: :timestamp,\n        optional: false\n      }\n    ]\n  end,\n\n  poll: lambda do |connection, input, last_updated_since|\n    page_size = 100\n    updated_since = (last_updated_since || input['since']).to_time.utc.iso8601\n\n    tickets = get(\"https://#{connection['helpdesk']}.freshdesk.com/api/v2/tickets.json\").\n              params(order_by: 'updated_at',\n                     order_type: 'asc',\n                     per_page: page_size,\n                     updated_since: updated_since)\n\n    next_updated_since = tickets.last['updated_at'] unless tickets.blank?\n\n    {\n      events: tickets,\n      next_poll: next_updated_since,\n      can_poll_more: tickets.length >= page_size\n    }\n  end,\n\n  dedup: lambda do |ticket|\n    ticket['id']\n  end,\n\n  output_fields: lambda do |object_definitions|\n    object_definitions['ticket']\n  end\n}\n\npoll\nArguments\nA poll block is given 3 arguments.\nThe first argument is connection, used to access inputs from connection field values. This is frequently used to access domain or subdomain information from the user.\ninput provides access to trigger input field values from the recipe. Inputs like \"created_since\" a particular date is usually used in a trigger to allow filtering historic records. In this case, Knack does not provide filtering by record created dates, input is given an empty array.\nThe last argument, usually given the name last_updated_since or last_created_since, is the cursor \"stored\" from a previous poll. This is crucial to a good trigger design. It is used to determine where the last poll stopped and where to begin next. As an example, it is usually given the last (latest) \"updated\"/\"created\" time. When the trigger is first started, this value is nil.\nOutput\npoll: lambda do |connection, input, last_updated_since|\n  page_size = 100\n  updated_since = (last_updated_since || input['since']).to_time.utc.iso8601\n\n  tickets = get(\"https://#{connection['helpdesk']}.freshdesk.com/api/v2/tickets.json\").\n            params(order_by: 'updated_at',\n                   order_type: 'asc',\n                   per_page: page_size,\n                   updated_since: updated_since)\n\n  next_updated_since = tickets.last['updated_at'] unless tickets.blank?\n\n  {\n    events: tickets,\n    next_poll: next_updated_since,\n    can_poll_more: tickets.length >= page_size\n  }\nend\n\nIn a classic type trigger, the expected output contains events, next_poll and can_poll_more.\nevents expects an array of individual results to be processed through the recipe as individual events.\nnext_poll is a cursor that will be passed on to the successive poll (third argument of poll block.\nImportant:\nThis trigger type does not have automatic-immediate polling. Immediate polling is determined by can_poll_more, which is a boolean value for whether an immediate poll should be made.\nExample JSON response:\n[\n  {\n    \"id\": 1,\n    \"updated_at\": \"2016-08-13T00:53:44Z\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": 2,\n    \"updated_at\": \"2016-09-14T02:25:00Z\"\n  },\n  ...\n]\n\nWhen a get request receives this JSON response, it looks up the array for the last record (latest record) and passes it as the cursor for the next poll. It also checks the response array size. If it is equal to the size limit, it is likely that there are more records matching this request in consequtive pages. Hence the expression given to can_poll_more evaluates to true and invokes an immediate successive poll. This loop continues until response array size is smaller than page limit.\nAt the end of the loop. The last (latest) created date is passed as next_poll. This value will be used in the next poll cycle to pick up new records.\ndedup\nDedup block is used to identify individual events. It is given a single argument \"event\", which corresponds to individual elements in the records array passed into \"events\".\nA typical dedup input is event[‘id’] where the event argument name can be replaced to make the code more readable. This should be used only in classic triggers.\ndedup: lambda do |ticket|\n  ticket[\"id\"]\nend\n\nIn some instances, a record needs to be proccessed as separate events. A typical scenario is updated records. To do this, append updated timestamp field to the dedup expression like so.\ndedup: lambda do |ticket|\n  ticket[\"id\"] + \"@\" + ticket[\"updated_at\"]\nend\n\nWith this, 2 occurence of a record with the same \"ID\" but with different \"updated_at\" values will be recorded as separate events.\nDescending Trigger\nnew_alert: {\n  type: :paging_desc,\n\n  input_fields: lambda do\n    [\n      {\n        name: 'since',\n        type: :timestamp,\n        optional: false\n      }\n    ]\n  end,\n\n  poll: lambda do |connection, input, page|\n    limit = 100\n    page ||= 0\n    created_since = (input['since'] || Time.now).to_i\n    offset = (limit * page)\n\n    response = get(\"https://api.pingdom.com/api/2.0/actions\").\n                 params(from: created_since,\n                        limit: limit,\n                        offset: offset)\n\n    {\n      events: response,\n      next_page: (response.length >= limit) ? page + 1 : nil\n    }\n  end,\n\n  document_id: lambda do |response|\n    response['checkid']\n  end,\n\n  sort_by: lambda do |response|\n    response['time']\n  end,\n\n  output_fields: lambda do |object_definitions|\n    object_definitions['alert']\n  end\n}\n\ntype\ntype: :paging_desc - This type should be used only if results are in descending order. A paging_desc trigger works by assuming a descending order and continuously poll for all unique records. If the API is unable to return records in descending order, ignore this key to use the classic trigger.\nA record of all event IDs (defined in document_id ) is recorded for each recipe. Each recipe will \"remember\" all event IDs that is processed through a trigger. \nBased on assumption of order, the trigger can stop the polling cycle once a similar event IDs is observed. This is because further polls will return events \"before\" and would have already been processed by the trigger. At this point, the trigger stops polling and wait for the new poll cycle for new events. The Workato trigger framework handles deduplication in the background.\npoll\nPoll block is where you define how events are obtained. Typically, a GET request is used to retrieve a list of records to be processed as trigger events.\nArguments\nDescending trigger polls have the exact same argument structure. connection, input and cursor. The one difference is that the last argument is usually given the name page. In a descending trigger, this argument is usually used to pass the page number instead of record timestamp.\nOutput\nSimilar to a classic trigger, the events in output here expects an array of results.\npoll: lambda do |connection, input, page|\n  limit = 100\n  page ||= 0\n  created_since = (input['since'] || Time.now).to_i\n  offset = (limit * page)\n\n  response = get(\"https://api.pingdom.com/api/2.0/actions\").\n               params(from: created_since,\n                      limit: limit,\n                      offset: offset)\n\n  {\n    events: response,\n    next_page: (response.length >= limit) ? page + 1 : nil\n  }\nend\n\nInstead of next_poll, paging_desc type trigger should be given next_page as cursor. It is used for passing the next page to be polled.\nA typical response looks like this.\n{\n  \"current\": \"https://api.sample.com/records?order=desc&from=2016-12-09T22%3A57%3A13Z&page=1\",\n  \"next\": \"https://api.sample.com/records?order=desc&from=2016-12-09T22%3A57%3A13Z&page=2\",\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"checkid\": 123,\n      \"time\": \"2016-12-13T19:09:01Z\",\n      ...\n    },\n    {\n      \"checkid\": 124,\n      \"time\": \"2016-12-10T06:20:00Z\",\n      ...\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nresponse[\"data\"] is an array of results from the request, which should be passed to events. While it varies between APIs, most will provide some form of pointer to the next page of results. In this example,response[\"next\"] is an API generated url to be used to retrieve the next page of results matching the request. Hence we can simply pass it to next_page. In the successive poll, this value is passed to the poll block and the next set of records is retrieved.\nOn the last page, response[\"next\"] is usually null. In that case, it will cause the successive poll to make the same request as in the first page. When this happens, the trigger framework detects a duplicate event (mechanism for detection explained in detail later) and halts all immediate polls. At this point, the trigger goes to \"sleep\" until the next poll cycle.\nNew records being added in the cloud instance will appear in the first page of requests since records are returned in descending order. The trigger picks up new records and processes them until a duplicate event is detected, at which point it \"sleeps\". This trigger type depends on a descending order to retrieve only \"new\" records and stops upon detection of \"old\" records.\nThis way, the trigger polls for new records efficiently, without making any repeated requests to retrieve the entire set of records in each poll cycle.\ndocument_id\nSimilar to dedup, paging_desc type triggers uses document_id to identify unique records. Write an expression that can uniquely identify the \"ID\" of records.\ndocument_id: lambda do |event|\n  event[\"checkid\"]\nend\n\nUnlike classic triggers, there is no need to include timestamp fields into the document_id expression to deduplicate updated records. Descending triggers have an additional block sort_by to process this.\nsort_by\nIn addition to document_id, this block is used to define the field that is used to sort records (in descending order). It could be \"created_at\" or \"updated_at\" or similar fields.\nsort_by: lambda do |event|\n  event[\"time\"]\nend\n\n"},"developing-connectors/sdk/trigger/webhook-trigger.html":{"url":"developing-connectors/sdk/trigger/webhook-trigger.html","title":"Webhook trigger","keywords":"","body":"Webhook Trigger\ntriggers: {\n  new_message: {\n    type: :paging_desc,\n\n    input_fields: lambda do |object_definitions|\n      object_definitions[\"room\"].only(\"id\")\n    end,\n\n    webhook_subscribe: lambda do |webhook_url, connection, input, recipe_id|\n      post(\"https://api.ciscospark.com/v1/webhooks\",\n           name: \"Workato recipe #{recipe_id}\",\n           targetUrl: webhook_url,\n           resource: \"messages\",\n           event: \"created\",\n           filter: \"roomId=#{input['id']}\")\n    end,\n\n    webhook_notification: lambda do |input, payload|\n      payload[\"data\"]\n    end,\n\n    webhook_unsubscribe: lambda do |webhook|\n      delete(\"https://api.ciscospark.com/v1/webhooks/#{webhook['id']}\")\n    end,\n\n    dedup: lambda do |message) {\n      message[\"id\"]\n    end,\n\n    output_fields: lambda do |object_definitions|\n      object_definitions[\"message\"]\n    end\n  }\n}\n\nwebhook_subscribe\nWhen a recipe is started, a webhook subscription should be created.

Let's break it down. Firstly, we define a POST to request to the appropriate endpoint:\npost(\"https://api.intacct.com/ia/xml/xmlgw.phtml\")\n\nNext, we add a payload to the request in the form of a hash first:\n.payload(\"control\": [\n         {\n           \"senderid\": [{ \"content!\": connection[\"sender_id\"] }],\n           \"password\": [{ \"content!\": connection[\"sender_password\"] }],\n           \"controlid\": [{ \"content!\": \"testControlId\" }],\n           \"uniqueid\": [{ \"content!\": false }],\n           \"dtdversion\": [{ \"content!\": 3.0 }]\n         }\n       ],\n       \"operation\": [\n         {\n           \"authentication\": [\n             {\n               \"login\": [\n                 {\n                   \"userid\": [{ \"content!\": connection[\"login_username\"] }],\n                   \"companyid\": [{ \"content!\": connection[\"company_id\"] }],\n                   \"password\": [{ \"content!\": connection[\"login_password\"] }]\n                 }\n               ]\n             }\n           ]\n           \"content\": [\n             {\n               \"function\": [\n                 {\n                   \"@controlid\": \"testControlId\",\n                   \"get_list\": [\n                     {\n                     \"@object\": \"glaccount\",\n                     \"@maxitems\": \"1\"\n                     }\n                   ]\n                 }\n               ]\n             }\n           ]\n         }\n       ])\n\nElements are represented by arrays of hashes, since XML elements can repeat without any extra notation. Element data is defined using the content! key and attributes using @ prefix (example: @object and @maxitems).\nNext, we add the necessary headers with the headers shorthand method:\n.headers(\"Content-type\": \"x-intacct-xml-request\")\n\nFinally, we use the format_xml method (since we require both request and response in XML) and pass it the root element name as an argument, request in this case.\n.format_xml(\"request\")\n\nNow, the response will be in this form:\n\n  \n    success\n    SENDER_ID\n    testControlId\n    false\n    3.0\n  \n  \n    \n      success\n      USER_ID\n      COMPANY_ID\n      2017-03-26T05:24:25-07:00\n    \n    \n      success\n      get_list\n      testControlId\n      glaccount\n      \n        \n          1\n          1000\n          Chase Operating Account\n          debit\n          balancesheet\n          closed to account\n          \n          06/03/2016 20:19:30\n          active\n          false\n          false\n          false\n          \n          \n          None\n          false\n          false\n          false\n          false\n          false\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nWhich will be returned to the connector as an equivalent hash (Similar to request, elements are represented by arrays of hashes, since XML elements can repeat without any extra notation).\n{\n  \"response\"=>[\n

For example, the fields for an object depends on the chosen object. Here, we introduce config_fields. It is an optional key available in both actions and triggers. It is a special type of input field that can be used to generate other dependent input/output fields. We see this in the merge_document action in Webmerge.\naction: {\n  merge_document: {\n    config_fields: [\n      # this field shows up first in recipe as a picklist of documents to use\n      {\n        name: \"document_id\",\n        label: \"Document\",\n        control_type: :select,\n        pick_list: \"documents\",\n        optional: false\n      }\n    ],\n\n    input_fields: lambda do |object_definition|\n      object_definition[\"document\"]\n    end,\n\n    execute: lambda do |_connection, input|\n      d = input[\"document_id\"].split(\"|\")\n      post(d.last.to_s, input)\n    end,\n\n    output_fields: lambda do |_object_definition|\n      [\n        {\n          name: \"success\"\n        }\n      ]\n    end\n  }\n}\n\nHere, the fields are different for each document, hence a user first chooses a document (from a pick list of documents available in the instance) which is then used to generate the remaining fields. This part is done by specifying that the \"document\" object definition is dependent on the value of \"document_id\" within config_field. Notice that the fields block accepts a second argument config_fields. This argument refers to the field(s) you define in config_fields in each action/trigger.\nobject_definition: {\n  document: {\n    fields: lambda do |_connection, config_fields|\n      return [] if config_fields.blank?\n      get(\"https://www.webmerge.me/api/documents/#{config_fields[\"document_id\"]}/fields\").\n        map { |field| field.slice(\"name\") }\n    end\n  }\n}\n\nWhile the config_fields is empty, document objects will have no fields (empty array of fields). As soon as config_fields is given a value, a request is made to retrieve the fields present in this document. From a recipe user perspective, the action will appear initially as a single input with a list of documents. After selecting a document, the corresponding set of fields will be generated, to be used in the recipe.\n"},"developing-connectors/sdk/examples.html":{"url":"developing-connectors/sdk/examples.html","title":"Examples","keywords":"","body":"Example Adapters\nBasic Authentication Samples\n\nHarvest app connector\n\nFreshdesk connector\n\nClearbit connector\n\nClose.io connector\n\nClick Time connector\n\nToggl connector\n\nUnbounce connector\n\nWatson Tone Analyzer connector\n\nDocparser connector\n\n\nOAuth2 Samples\n\nPodio connector\n\nProductHunt connector\n\nAccelo connector\n\nPushbullet connector\n\nWrike connector\n\nCisco Spark connector\n\nAMcards connector\n\n\nAPI Key Authentication Samples\n\nGender API connector\n\nHipchat connector\n\nCodeship connector\n\n\nCustom Authentication Samples\n\nLoJack app connector\n\nSafetyCulture app connector\n\nKnack HQ connector\n\nNeto connector\n\nTSheets connector\n\n\nCheck out the full list of example custom adapters built by developers here\n"},"troubleshooting.html":{"url":"troubleshooting.html","title":"Troubleshooting","keywords":"","body":""},"recipes/action-errors.html":{"url":"recipes/action-errors.html","title":"Action errors","keywords":"","body":"Action Errors\nWhen working on Workato, you will occasionally encounter errors. Errors arise when something has gone wrong with the recipe, like when a recipe wasn't configured properly, or the app you are trying to connect with is experiencing downtime. Job Failures and how to deal with them\nWhen one of your recipes encounters an error, you will receive an email informing you about it. You will also see a red \nrJD7hmlUodRmH3X4krGRFqY-l3X8P14SLw.png\nThis is a sample of a recipe. The red digit is the number of errors or failed jobs while the green count is the number of successful jobs. You can check out your failed jobs at the \"Jobs\" section after you click into a recipe.\n\nIf you have many jobs in your job history, you can also filter out jobs based on the status of the jobs, so that you can see all the failed jobs at a glance. \n\nUnderstanding failed job messages\nNow that you know how to view failed jobs, its time to learn how to understand failed job messages. When you click onto the failed job, you will be able to take a look at the job page.\n\nThe job page has a few pieces of information that you should be aware of : \nError : Gives you the exact error message from the connector\nError Type : Tells you a general message about what the error is about.\nSource      : Where the error is coming from.\nRed Line | : The red line appears on the left side of an action, andshows the step that is throwing the error. (In the above case, this is on step 3) \nCommon root causes for failure are : \n\nA Required input field was empty. It may not be filled with any value, or the data pill used in that field does not have any value.\nAn object couldn't be found using the key/ID provided in the field.\nYou attempted to create an object with the same/existing names available.\nImproper Formula mode conditions were applied on a null pill \n\nTracing your recipe\nWhen your recipes get too complicated, errors are hard to follow. The best way to trace your errors is a bottom-up approach. Start from where the error is coming from, and work your way from there and follow the data. Here is an example of how you can trace errors\n\nStart with identifying which field in the error step that is rejecting the input. \nOpen up your recipe in a new browser tab. Check what is filled up in that specific field  \nTrace the possible field that is providing the wrong value. Then, check out where the value comes from in that step. \nThe data pill will most probably come from a different step. Now go back to the job page, and check at the output data of that step, and see what is the provided value for that step. \nYou can keep going down the chain to reach the root of the data source. \n\nExample\nErrors are messages that are very important to understand what is wrong. You should devise the meaning of these messages. Some errors are a little more complicated, while some are pretty straightforward. \nKnowing where the source of error is coming from is also very useful to know why is the error being thrown. For example, When we try to make a contact marketable, you may hit an error that is unique to only Infusionsoft : \n \nErrors like this give a whole lot more context into what went wrong, and what can you do to fix them.\nIdentifying the step that error that was being thrown is the most important. The first thing you will need to do is to associate the input data in that step with the error message. \n\nSeems that the company field is empty in my recipe. I need to have a company in my Salesforce's Lead to create one\nI then go back to my recipe, and see what is filled in the Company field in Step 3. Seems like I have a data pill in that field already. I click on the data pill, and it shows that it comes from the Trigger. \n\nNow, I will check what is the actual data that the specific failed job received from the trigger record. I look for the Company value under Profile (where the data pill came from), and found that it does not exist. Seems that the reason that the recipe failed was because it used a data pill that has no value in it. \n\nI want to make sure that there is always value provided in required fields. To do so, I will need to be able to choose a second alternative data pill that I can ensure there is always value in it. \n\nIn this case, I know that there is always a First Name in the Eventbrite's profile. I will turn on formula mode, and put an OR in between the data pills.\n\nNow, if the data pill \"Company\" does not have any value, it will use the value that comes from First Name. I make the change in my recipe, and try re-running the failed job. Seems like it's been completed!\nTo find information on the errors you are facing, simply run a search on our helpdesk with keywords of the error such as the source and details.

Warnings look similar to this:\n\nWhat is the difference between a job error and a trigger warning?\nHow to resolve trigger warnings\nResolving trigger warnings depend on the type of error in the warning. The most common trigger warnings are as follows:\nAPI limit Errors\nSchema Errors\n"},"recipes/formula-errors.html":{"url":"recipes/formula-errors.html","title":"Formula errors","keywords":"","body":"Formula Errors\nWhen formula mode functions are used incorrectly, your Workato recipes will not work in the manner according to your intentions. \nThis section will showcase the most frequent occurances of formula errors and how to troubleshoot them.\nTypes of Formula Errors\nThere are two types of formula errors - Formula Compilation Error and Formula Runtime Error. \nFormula Compilation Error\nFormula compilation error occurs when you have used formula mode within one of your fields in a recipe, but have most likely mispelled the formula function.\nIdentifying the Error\n You will identify that formula compilation error has occured when trying to to test or start the recipe. Workato prevents you from doing so and instead indicates that there is a formula error, and mentions which line in the recipe the error originates from. \nIn the example below, there is no such formula function as .nosuchformula, and the recipe is prevented from being started. \n\nTroubleshooting the Error\nTo troubleshoot and resolve the error, simply open the indicated lines, check and correct the formula functions used in the fields which are in formula mode. \nIn some cases, you might have accidentally turned on the formula mode field without intention, also resulting in the formula compilation error.\nFormula Runtime Error\nFormula runtime error is slightly trickier to troubleshoot. In these cases, the formula functions in the field are spelt correctly, but have most likely been used in an incorrect manner. We will look look at two examples below. \nIdentifying the Error (Example 1: Formula received a nil value)\nFormula runtime errors are not as straightforward to identify as compilation errors. Instead, they are discovered to be present when a recipe error is encountered and when looking through the job report. \n\nTaking a look at the GIF above, the identified error is:\n Error calculating input for field 'title': Formula received a nil value: undefined method '+' for nil:NilClass\nYOu can see that the error description suggests the Formula function has failed because it receives an unexpected value. In other words, it implies that in one of the step's field, there lies a wrong use of a formula function that has caused the recipe to fail.\nTroubleshooting the Error\nWhen heading the recipe step, the recipe field shows two data pills concatenated between two strings. By taking a look at the data pills, it suggests that both data pills are empty for this particular record, and caused the formula mode to fail.\n\nTo fix this case, we need to ensure that the formula field always return a value, or makes sure that the data pill that I used will always return a certain value. \nIn short, the most important thing would be to figure out if the formula function is used correctly.\nIdentifying the Error (Example 2: No Method Error)\nAgain, looking through the job report will allow you to take a look at the recipe error. The no method error is another obvious keyword that highlights a formula error. \n\nTaking a look at the GIF above, the identified error is:\n NoMethodError: undefined method `include?' for 2:Fixnum\nTroubleshooting the Error\nTo be able to solve this error, we need to learn more about the .include? formula function. There actually exists such a method in the Workato platform. .include? is useful to determine if a certain data pill contains a certain text. \n\nHowever, when using the function on certain data pills or value that is numerical or non-text, it will not be able to accept the input and process it. The error is a result of such misuse, where literal numbers or non-text data pills are called on with .include?. (See Image above)\nTo resolve this, first check if the value in the data pill is returned as a number. If yes, you may first use .to_s to turn the number into literal text before applying .include?\n"},"recipes/infinite-loops.html":{"url":"recipes/infinite-loops.html","title":"Infinite loops","keywords":"","body":"Infinite Loops\nWhat are infinite loops and when do they occur?\nInfinite loops are logic errors that cause a recipe to run continuously because an action in the recipe is also triggering the recipe again.\nInfinite loops occur most commonly when the recipe is performing a bi-directional sync (ie. when there is more than 1 application and data moves from Application A to Application B and back to A) \nThe example below shows how an infinite loop may occur: \n\nThe trigger picks up any New or Updated Contact in Salesforce. \n\nIn the final step, the recipe is configured to update the same object with information from QuickBooks.\n\nBecause of this update step, the recipe is triggered again since the trigger uses two date/time fields (i.e. Created Date and Last Modified ) in the object records to determine if the record was newly created or updated.\nInfinite loops may also occur if you have multiple recipes running at once and a similar issue occurs where one recipe is updating another that is triggered by an update in an object.\nSigns the recipe is in an infinite loop\nRecipes may be in an infinite loop if:\n\nThere is an unexpectedly high transaction count \n\nThe recipe is triggered when there are no new trigger events in the applications\n\nThere are many duplicates of an object in applications that was created by a recipe\n\n\nHow to prevent infinite loops\nTrigger Filters\nIn order to stop the re-triggering of recipes, implement filters in the trigger. An example of how this can be done is as follows:\n\nFrom the image above, we can see that the action is updating the 'Opportunity' object in Salesforce with the QuickBooks Invoice ID and URL. This update is made to the field: Contact Description. \nThus, in the trigger, filter out the jobs that already have an entry in this field. This prevents the job from running again as every job that has been succesfully synced by Workato will populate the field with data. \nThe update will be picked up by Workato but not processed as it is filtered out by the trigger filter.\nBest Practices\nCreating Custom Fields\nCreate fields in the connected applications that are meant for identifying jobs synced by Workato. Referring to the above example in 'Trigger Filters', the Contact Description field in the Salesforce Opportunity should always be empty so that Workato will identify that as a job to be synced over.\nThus, it is not advisable to use a commonly used field for these purposes, as they may be filled in by mistake and cause that job to be filtered out in the trigger. \nUse specific labels like: \"Synced by Workato\" or \"QuickBooks Invoice URL\" to prevent mistakes like these from happening.\n"},"recipes/deduplication.html":{"url":"recipes/deduplication.html","title":"Deduplication","keywords":"","body":"Deduplication\nWhy should I ensure steps are taken for deduplication in my recipes?\nDeduplication ensures only 1 unique instance is stored in each of your applications. Ensuring that the steps below are taken in every recipe will prevent unwanted duplicates of the same record which can make data in your business applications very messy.\nStep-by-Step Guide\nView this recipe to see an example of how deduplication can be done with Workato in a few simple steps: https://www.workato.com/recipes/486082\n1. Trigger\nIn this recipe, the trigger event is a New or Updated Contact in Salesforce. This means that whenever a Contact is created or updated in Salesforce, the recipe runs.\n\n2. Search\nThe search action searches the QuickBooks for the Display name which corresponds to the Contact's full name in Salesforce. \n\nUnique Identifiers in Applications\nTo ensure that there is only 1 unique instance in each application when performing searches, use a unique identifer. In QuickBooks, the Display Name is one of them (ie. Display Names are unique in QuickBooks and no 2 customers can have the same display name). \nIn other applications, commonly used identifiers are IDs and Record Numbers. These numbers can often be found appended to the end of the URL of the object.\n3. Conditional Actions\nTo ensure the search action is looking for a perfect match, the conditional action that follows uses the 'is present' and 'is not present' conditions. \n\nTip: If you wish to do a partial search, use the 'Contains' condition.\nThe Data field you want to test is also a unique identifier in QuickBooks. In this case, Customer ID is used. For every Customer in QuickBooks, there is a unique ID. Thus, if the 'Search' action finds a customer in QuickBooks with a corresponding name, the Customer ID is sure to exist.\nIf a customer is found, the Customer ID will be present. In this case, we want to update this record in QuickBooks. This can be used to update information such as the Customer's phone number, email, billing/shipping addresses etc.\nIn step 4, if a Customer is not found, we want to create a new customer record using existing information from Salesforce.\n\n"},"recipes/rate-limiting.html":{"url":"recipes/rate-limiting.html","title":"Rate limiting","keywords":"","body":"Rate limiting\nMost APIs have a cap on the number of API calls you can make within a certain period.
