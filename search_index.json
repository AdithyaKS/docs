is Workato?\nWorkato is an integration platform that connects cloud applications and on-premise applications. This platform combines an enterprise-grade integration platform with the ease of use associated with consumer applications. This enables users to easily build, deploy and manage complex app integrations.\nThe integration problem\nMost businesses have multiple applications in use that handle operational data. These frequently include both cloud-based and on-premise applications. In addition, personal and business productivity applications such as chat, social media, calendering, and the like are a key part of daily work and data from these is often unintegrated with other business data.\nWithout automated integration, organizations cannot leverage the full power of data in their multiple applications, re-enter data multiple times across applications, constantly context-switch across applications to accomplish tasks, and so on.\nThe challenges of integration\nAutomated integration solves the problem of data siloes. But if you are going to automate transactions that span applications, then these processes must be reliable, secure, and manageable. Business and IT users need visibility into the running integrations and the capability to take appropriate action if an error or exception occurs.\nA viable integration solution must be able to handle the complexities of real-world problems. Real-world integration problems often require more than just transporting single data objects across applications. They may require multi-step processes with business logic, workflow capabilities, one-to-many or many-to-one data mappings, and other such challenges. Too, many applications typically are customized for a particular business, and integrations must handle these customizations, since they are a part of the organization’s business processes.\nSome of the issues we see with integration solutions today:\n\nIntegration platform products are relatively high cost, sometimes costing more than the applications being connected\n\nPowerful integration products are oriented toward technical users, while citizen integrator products sacrifice capability for usability\n\nCitizen integrator products need to be enterprise-grade in terms of reliability, scalability and security\n\nAdding new, complex integrations can involve long implementation times spanning months, while new apps are coming online much faster than that\n\nIT needs visibility into the integration processes. Where necessary, it should be possible for IT and business users to collaborate to create and manage integration solutions.\n\n\nWorkato addresses these issues with an enterprise-class integration tool that can be governed and monitored by IT, but with the ease of use and low barrier to entry expected from modern cloud applications.\nEnterprise-grade foundation\nThe Workato platform has a powerful feature set to handle real-world problems, including the integration of applications, data and people. Both cloud-based and on-premise systems are supported. The runtime system is designed for security, robustness, reliability and high performance.\nSelf-service user interface\nWorkato’s user interface is designed to be easy to use for non-technical users and enables rapid deployment of integration solutions. At the same time, it enables users with more technical and application expertise to deeply extend and customize the platform.\nConversational integration\nWorkbots enable control of, and notifications from, business applications from within personal productivity apps, on both mobile and desktop devices. Workbots build a bridge between Systems of Engagement (SoE) and Systems of Reference (SoR) for business users.\nIT Governance\nWorkato Aegis is a management tool that provides cross-enterprise visibility into deployed integration processes and the applications they connect. Workato Aegis supports assigning differing levels of responsibility and visibility within the platform, and enables collaboration between business and IT users. It enables implementation and enforcement of policies to improve security and governance across all Workato users within an enterprise.\nExtensible platform\nWorkato’s platform is extensible to add support for new applications beyond the many that are available pre-built. A powerful and configurable REST data connector allows integration to many systems without writing of code. Workato also provides a Connector SDK that handles and abstracts multiple aspects of application and data integration for cases where custom development is required. Existing connectors can be extended via the SDK or via adding functions from the REST connector. In addition, a public API allows control of recipes from third-party applications.\n"},"workato-concepts.html":{"url":"workato-concepts.html","title":"Concepts","keywords":"","body":"Concepts\nThere are some Workato terminology that you might hear being punted around all the time. The core concepts and basic building blocks of Workato you'd need to know in order to understand most of the following documentation are covered briefly in this section.\nRecipes\nRecipes are automated workflows built by users that can span across multiple apps, e.g. moving new Salesforce accounts into Zendesk as new organizations. Each recipe comprises of a trigger and one or more actions that are carried out when a trigger event is picked up.\nWhen recipes are started and become active, they will run automatically in the background to listen to trigger events and carry out recipe actions. When they are stopped and become inactive, they will cease listening to trigger events.\nHowever, when a recipe is started again, it usually picks up all the trigger events it had not processed, from since the recipe was stopped till when the recipe was started again. Hence, any recipe restarted from a stopped state will resume from the point in time it was stopped.\nAll recipes have a unique ID that identifies them.\n\nRecipe IDs can be viewed from the URL on the recipe page\nExample of a recipe\nThe following is a simple recipe with one trigger and one action. The scenario is to move new Salesforce customers (known in Salesforce as accounts) into Zendesk as customers (known in Zendesk as organizations).\nThe trigger is New Salesforce account - this means that the recipe will trigger whenever a new Salesforce account is created within the connected Salesforce organization. The action is Create Zendesk organization - this means that a Zendesk organization will be created whenever a trigger event occurs (when a new account is created in Salesforce).\n\nExample of a recipe that moves new Salesforce accounts into Zendesk as organizations\nTriggers\nTriggers are part of a recipe, and all recipes need a single trigger. Triggers determine what event to listen to in order to kick off the recipe flow. You can read more about triggers here.\nIn the following example recipe, the trigger is New Salesforce account.\n\nExample of a recipe that moves new Salesforce accounts into Zendesk as organizations\nSteps and actions\nAll recipes need a minimum of one step. The most basic step for a recipe is an action, which carries out operations automatically whenever a trigger event occurs to kicks off the recipe flow.\nYou can read more about recipe steps here and actions here.\nIn the following example recipe, the action is Create Zendesk organization.\n\nExample of a recipe that moves new Salesforce accounts into Zendesk as organizations\nOutput datatree and data pills\nAlmost all triggers and actions have an output datatree. These datatree contains all the variables available for use after the trigger event has happened and after the action has been carried out. These variables are typically called data pills. You can read more about data pills here.\nOn the right of these data pills, there are samples of real data retrieved from the connected app, to display what the data looks like within the app.\nExample of an output datatree and data pills\nThe following is the output datatree for the trigger New Salesforce account. This datatree contains all the variables known to us and available for use whenever a trigger event occurs.\n\nOutput datatree for New Salesforce account trigger\nFor example, as seen in the screenshot, whenever a new Salesforce account is created, we're able to get the following values for this particular new Salesforce account:\nAccount description,\nAccount fax,\nAccount ID,\nAccount name,\nAccount number,\nAccount phone,\nAccount rating,\nAccount site,\nAccount source,\netc.\nThese values can be used in subsequent steps of the recipe by being passed into input fields, as covered next.\nInput fields and fields mapping\nAlmost all triggers and actions have input fields. Input fields are how triggers and actions are designed to carry out customized workflows, and they can take in variables (datapills) or constants.\nWhen we insert variables (datapills) or constants into input fields, that's called fields mapping. You can read more about fields mapping here.\nExample of input fields\nThe following is an expanded view of the Create Zendesk organization action. In this view, we can see two input fields: Name and Notes.\n\nInput fields for the action Create Zendesk organization\nMapping variables\nThe variable Account name has been mapped to the Name input field. This means that for every new Salesforce account that is created, the account name of this Salesforce account will be used as the organization name of the Zendesk organization that will be created. For example, a new Salesforce account named Sattei Winery will in turn create a Zendesk organization named Sattei Winery.\n\nInput field with variable mapping\nMapping constants\nOn the other hand, the input field Notes has a constant mapped to it - the words \"Synced over from Salesforce.\" This means that all newly created Zendesk organizations created via Workato will have the words \"Synced over from Salesforce.\" in its Notes field.\n\nInput field with constant mapping\nHere's an example of the new Zendesk organization created via the above mapping:\n\nNewly created Zendesk organization Sattei Winery\nConnections\nFor a recipe to communicate with apps to read or write to them, it has to be connected to these apps. Custom data from the apps like custom fields and sample data in the datatree may not be visible if a connection has not been established. Connections are not tied to a recipe - a single connection can be used by multiple recipes. You can read more about connections here.\n\nSalesforce and Zendesk connections from the recipe view\nJobs report\nThe job report gives a high-level summary of the trigger events processed by the recipe. The entire flow of each trigger event through the recipe is called a job.\nInformation such as date, time processed and job IDs, can be found here. From this jobs history page, users can view more detailed information about a job by clicking on it.\nYou can read more about job reports here.\n\nJobs report page\nJob details page\nThe job details page provides step-by-step input/output details of a single trigger event as it is processed by the recipe. This page is useful for troubleshooting recipes as users are able to view the data passed into each step and the resultant output returned after each step was executed. You can read more about jobs and job details here.\n\nJob details page showing the syncing of Salesforce account Myers Brewery to Zendesk\n"},"connections.html":{"url":"connections.html","title":"Connections","keywords":"","body":"App connections\nRecipes are automated worflows that read data from and write data to apps. In order to interact with app data, Workato needs to be connected to these applications. Connectors typically require a connection before triggers and actions can be configured, as they need to retrieve custom objects and custom fields from the connected apps.\n\nRecipe prompts user to connect to their Salesforce organization. Picklist is greyed out because the Salesforce connector does not know what objects are available in the unconnected organization.\nConnections are created when a user authenticates with the app via Workato, and gives permission to Workato to access the data. Each connection should correspond to a single app instance, hence multiple recipes can and should utilize the same connection if working with the same app instance.\nAuthentication\nAuthentication usually occur the following standard ways, although there are some apps with custom authentication flows.\n\nOAuth2\nBasic authentication\nAPI keys or secrets\n\nIn each of the highlighted authentication flows, an app user has to verify that Workato has permission to access app data. The exact permissions Workato will get to read from and write to the app usually corresponds with the permissions of the connected app user.\nFor more information on connecting to a specific app, refer to the specific connector documentation.\nExample of OAuth2 authentication flow for Salesforce\nThe following recipe requires both Salesforce and a Zendesk connections, which are OAuth2. The Connection tab within the recipe shows further details about the app connections.\n\nExample recipe\nThe following shows the Connections tab. Zendesk has been connected, but the Salesforce connector has no connection established yet.\n\nRecipe without a Salesforce connection established\nClicking on the Connect button generates a popup that requests for Salesforce login credentials. Because Salesforce utilizes the standard OAuth2 authentication flow, usernames and passwords are provided only to Salesforce. Providing these credentials assure Salesforce that the user is giving permission for Workato to access their Salesforce data.\n\nOAuth2 authentication popup for Salesforce\nAfter providing credentials, Salesforce will show up as connected.\n\nRecipe with Salesforce and Zendesk connections established\nIntegration user\nWorkato recipes usually automate the workflows of a company or a department via the app API,\nand the permissions required might therefore span multiple users and roles. As a result, the connected user is typically a special integration user created to manage Workato integrations, with API access rights and permissions that enable integrations to work successfully.\nFor example:\n\nA recipe that moves new Salesforce accounts into Zendesk as new organizations will need read access to Salesforce accounts and write access for Zendesk organizations.\nA recipe that moves new Salesforce cases into JIRA as new issues will need read access to Salesforce cases and write access for JIRA issues.\n\nApps have different granularity when it comes to defining user roles and permissions. Refer to the specific connector documentation for more information on required permissions to connect to the app.\nUsing connections in recipes\nOne app connection has to be created for each instance of an app. For example, a single Salesforce connection needs to be created for each Salesforce organization, and a single JIRA connection needs to be created for each JIRA team. In cases whereby there are more than 1 app instance to connect to, e.g. when working with sandboxes and production organizations or teams, multiple connections should be created, with each connection authenticated with each separate instance.\nMost Workato connectors allow only one connection to used in a a recipe. There are some connectors which allows for two instances to be connected to a recipe. The following shows the primary and secondary Salesforce connectors being used in a recipe.\n\nExample recipe\nThe recipe correspondingly requires two Salesforce connections.\n\nPrimary and secondary Salesforce connections\nRefer to the Secondary connectors article to find out more.\n"},"recipes/building-recipes.html":{"url":"recipes/building-recipes.html","title":"Building recipes","keywords":"","body":""},"recipes/triggers.html":{"url":"recipes/triggers.html","title":"Triggers","keywords":"","body":"Triggers\nPolling triggers\nWhen the recipe is first started, the polling trigger polls and fetches all events after the From date. Subsequently, polls are made at regular intervals to ensure all trigger events are fetched. Poll frequency depends on the Workato plan.\nWhen the recipe is stopped, polling triggers stop fetching events from the trigger app. However, if the recipe is started again, polling triggers will fetch all events since the recipe was stopped.\nPolling trigger example\nA Workato account on the Business plan has a 5-minute polling interval, as displayed on their polling triggers.\n\nTrigger hint regarding the specific polling interval\nThe recipe polls every 5 minutes for new accounts created in Salesforce, and fetches any new accounts as trigger events. If the recipe is stopped on 1 Feb 2017, midnight PST, it will cease to fetch trigger events. However, if the recipe is started again on 1 March 2017, midnight PST, it will fetch all Salesforce accounts created since 1 Feb 2017, midnight PST.\nReal-time triggers\nReal-time triggers are usually based on webhooks. Events are fetched from the trigger app as soon as the event happens.\nReal-time triggers supported by Workato (this excludes HTTP real-time triggers) are also polling triggers - when first started, the recipe does a poll to fetch all events after the From date. Subsequently, polls are made on a regular basis to ensure all trigger events are fetched.\nBatch triggers\nBatch triggers are similar to polling triggers in fetching the same records. However, where polling triggers have trigger events corresponding to a single record, batch triggers have trigger events corresponding to a list of records. Maximum batch size can usually be defined in the trigger configuration.\nFor further details about batch triggers, refer to the Batch processing article here.\nScheduled triggers\nScheduled triggers are executed at defined days and times, either hourly, daily, or monthly.\n\nVarious schedule options for Salesforce scheduled search trigger\nWhen executed, records matching the search criteria will be returned, irrespective of whether the trigger had already picked it up in previous polls. These records will be returned in batches, with a user-defined maximum batch size.\nSince/From\nThe Since or From parameter found within the trigger enables fetching of trigger events from a specified date and time. This value can only be set once, and will be locked from further changing after the recipe has been started for the first time.\nHowever, not all triggers have the Since/From parameter. For such triggers, the date and time from which trigger events will be fetched is predetermined by default, usually as an offset from the time the recipe is first ran. Common values are:\n\nWhen recipe is first started\nAn hour before recipe is first started\nA day before recipe is first started.\n\nThis offset is usually communicated in the trigger hint.\n\nTrigger hint regarding the default offset of 1 hour ago for Google Calendar\nSince/From parameter example\nIn the following case, we're setting the From date as 1 Jan 2017, midnight PST, and then setting the object as Accounts.\n\nSetting the Since date for the trigger. Trigger will only pick up new accounts created since midnight of Jan 1, 2017\nWhen the recipe is started, only Salesforce accounts created after 1 Jan 2017, midnight PST will be picked up, as viewed from the created date column on the job report.\n\nCustom job report showing that Salesforce accounts picked up were created after Jan 1, 2017\nSimilarly, if the trigger was New/updated Salesforce object with the Account object selected, only Salesforce accounts created or updated after 1 Jan 2017, midnight PST will be picked up.\nTrigger conditions\nTrigger conditions are client-side filters that enable users to define the trigger events they wish to be processed by the recipe. This means that the connected app still retrieves and passes all trigger events to Workato, but the Workato trigger will filter for only events the user wants.\nAdding conditions to triggers will filter for only relevant trigger events to process, and reduce transaction counts. Trigger conditions can be combined using ORs only, or ANDs only.\nHowever, not all triggers have trigger conditions. For such triggers, there is no way to filter for relevant trigger events.\nTrigger conditions example\nTo add a trigger condition, check the Trigger IF checkbox. The trigger datatree will appear, displaying the variables available to be filtered by.\n\nChecking the Trigger IF checkbox brings up trigger condition fields to be configured\nDefine the trigger condition. The following ensures that only Salesforce accounts with a Warm rating value will be picked up by the trigger. Values are case sensitive and should be exact.\n\nDefine the trigger condition\nTo add an additional trigger conditions, select from the OR or AND in the picklist. The selected operator will define how all additional trigger conditions will be added.\n\nAdding another trigger condition with the OR operator\nDefine the additional trigger condition. Values are case sensitive and should be exact. The following ensures that accounts with a Hot rating value will also be picked up by the trigger. Notice that from the third trigger condition onwards, trigger conditions will be combined with the previously selected operator (OR or AND).\n\nDefine the additional trigger condition. Subsequent trigger conditions has to use the same AND operator\n"},"recipes/steps.html":{"url":"recipes/steps.html","title":"Steps","keywords":"","body":"Steps\nThere are various types of recipe steps that can be added to recipes, each with different logic.\n\nVarious recipe steps available in recipe editor\nAction\nActions carry out an operation in your target app, usually a create, update, or search operation. Each action usually has a set of input fields and an output datatree.\nAction step example\nThe following step carries out a Search organizations action in Zendesk. The input fields on the left shows the available fields to search for a Zendesk organization by:\n\nName\nTags\nNotes\nDetails\n\nIn the following case, the Search organization action is carried out by name.\n\nMapping fields to an action step Example recipe\nWhen the Search organizations action has been carried out, Zendesk returns data about the organizations found, if any. The output datatree displays available fields for mapping in subsequent steps.\nIn the following case, the Update organization action uses the ID field from the Search organizations action to identify which Zendesk organization to update (ID field as highlighted).\n\nMapping fields to an action step Example recipe\nConditional action\nConditional actions will only be carried out if the defined condition is true. All actions indented within a conditional action block will be carried out if that condition is true.\nConditional step example\nThe following recipe has two conditional steps:\n\nIf Zendesk organization was found, update Zendesk organization\nIf Zendesk organization was not found, create new Zendesk organization\n\n\nRecipe that uses conditional steps to decide whether to create or update Zendesk organization Example recipe\nAny job ran by this recipe can only proceed through either one of the conditional step, as the Zendesk organization must have either been found or not.\nRepeat step\nThe repeat step works with lists to carry out a series of actions on every item in that list. Actions indented within a repeat block will be carried out for all items in the list.\nFirst, select the list to iterate through. In order to use the values from each element of the list, all data fields must be from the Foreach datatree.\nRepeat step example\nRefer to the example scenario of syncing Salesforce accounts (using the batch trigger) to Zendesk as organizations.\n\nRecipe that uses the Repeat step to iterate through list of Salesforce accounts Example recipe\nAs the batch trigger returns a list of newly created Salesforce accounts, all records in this list have to be moved into Zendesk. However, as the Zendesk API does not have a batch write funtionality, the repeat action is required to iterate through this list of Salesforce accounts and repeat the action of creating the corresponding Zendesk organization for each Salesforce account.\nThe list datapill has to be passed into the repeat step. When the input list field is selected, only list type datapills are usable in the datatree, as portrayed in the GIF. List type pills can also be identified via their stack icon.\n\nMapping a list data pill into the Repeat step's input list field Example recipe\nDatapills from the Foreach output datatree should be mapped to ensure that values from each list item are used when the action is repeated. For example, if two Salesforce accounts were fetched by the trigger, using pills from the Foreach datatree ensures that the Create organization action creates a Zendesk organization with the data from the first Salesforce account on its first iteration, then with the data from the second Salesforce account on its second iteration.\n\nUsing datapills from the Repeat step's datatree. This ensures values from the list being iterated through are used. Example recipe\nThe following displays the mapping from the Foreach datatree.\n\nDatapills are mapped from the Repeat step's datatree Example recipe\nFor further Repeat step examples or more info about list processing, refer to the List management article.\nCall recipe\nCall recipe will run another recipe (named a callable recipe). Callable recipes are usually built to extract a set of common steps, which multiple recipes use, into a separate recipe that all main recipes can use. This reduces the complexity of individual recipes.\nCallable recipes are an advanced feature in Workato that you can read more about in the Callable recipes article.\nStop\nThe stop step ends a single job from being processed any further. It is usually used in cases whereby there are no recipe errors (i.e. no error is thrown in the job), but where there may be business errors and no data should be processed.\nThe stop step can be configured to mark the job as a failed job or a successful job, depending on business logic. If marking the job as failed, an explantory error message is required.\n\nConfigure the Stop step to mark the job as successful or failed Example recipe\nStop step example\nThe following recipe expects all Salesforce accounts to be present in Zendesk as organizations. In cases whereby no matching Zendesk organization is found, no recipe error is thrown as the search simply returns an empty list. In this case, the recipe will send an email to the recipe owner before ending the job.\n\nRecipe that utilizes the Stop step to send email and end job Example recipe\nThe recipe also marks the job as an error, so that the recipe owner will take notice of this job and attempt to rerun it.\n\nConfiguring the Step step's error message Example recipe\nAny job ran by this recipe can only proceed through either one of the conditional step, as the Zendesk organization must have either been found or not. If not found, the job will stop at Step 4. If found, the job will not carry out actions within the conditional step (Steps 3 and 4), instead only updating the matching Zendesk organization.\nAction with error handler\nThis step, also known as the try-catch step, is used to define remedial actions when errors occur. Common remedial steps are to notify users of the error via email or error messages in the app, or to carry out a rollback (i.e. reversing the job by deleting any created or half-created records).\nThere are 2 blocks: the Monitor actions for error and the On error block. All actions to be carried out should be within the Monitor block. If all actions are successful, the On error block will be ignored. However, if any step in the Moitor block fails, the actions within the On error block will be carried out.\nError handler step example\nThe following recipe tries to update the Zendesk organization right after the search step, irrespective of whether any Zendesk organizations were found. In cases whereby no Zendesk organization matching the Salesforce account name was found, the Update organization step fails.\n\nRecipe that uses the error monitor to monitor failures in updating Zendesk organizations Example recipe\nAs the recipe catches failed actions within the error monitor block, failed Update organization actions will be caught, and the recipe proceeds to carry out steps within the On error block. In this case, it seems that the only reason for the update failing is because no matching Zendesk organization was found. Hence the remedial step creates a new Zendesk organization.\n"},"recipes/actions.html":{"url":"recipes/actions.html","title":"Actions","keywords":"","body":"Actions\nThere are a variety of standard actions available on Workato such as Create, update, upsert, search, get and delete. We will be using the apps Zendesk and Salesforce in a Workato recipe to better illustrate these actions. You may visit the Workato recipe here and install them into your own Workato account if you would like test out these actions yourself. \nCreate\nThe Create Object action allows you to create any standard or custom object. In Salesforce, creating an account requires at least an Account Name to be stated. \n\nUpdate\nThe Update Object action allows you to make changes and edits on any existing standard or custom object. In order to pinpoint on which object you will be updating, you would have to minimally input in the Object ID. Updating a Salesforce account will mean having to input in the Account ID. \n\nSearch\nThe search action act like a search engine - pass in the keywords (some actions ask for the exact keywords, some actions ask for partial keywords) and the details of the matching object will be provided to you. If Search actions don't find a matching object, the action will not fail, neither will they return anything. This might cause subsequent actions expecting values to be passed to them to fail. You can also think of Search actions like a filter that filters the specified conditions, and all the subsequent actions will be based on the specified \"filter\".\n\nGet\nGet actions are more pinpointed - they require a unique ID to be passed to them, and the details of the matching object will be provided to you. If Get actions don't find a matching object, it will fail immediately. In the case of Salesforce, using the Get action on an Account will require you to input the Salesforce Account ID. \n\nUpsert\nWorkato supports certain connectors with the Upsert command, which is a combination of the search, update and create(insert) actions. When used, Salesforce will perform a search for the object based on the object ID, create the object if it does not exist yet, else perform an update on it with the input field values.\n\nDelete\nThe delete action is supported by only a select number of applications on Workato. It allows the user to delete any standard or custom object by parsing in the Object ID. As the nature of this action can irreversibly lead to lost data, it is best to be cautious and understand the implications when using this action in Workato recipes.    \n\n"},"recipes/data-pills.html":{"url":"recipes/data-pills.html","title":"Data pills and types","keywords":"","body":"Data pills\nData pills are variables that you use to build recipes, and contain values from previous recipe steps that you can use in your recipe. Data pills are used during design-time (when you're building your recipe, as opposed to when you're running it) to create a template that tells relevant data where to go.\nData pills are usually found within datatrees, within the App Data section.\n\nDatatree within a recipe step\nWhen you're configuring a recipe step, all data from previous steps will be available for use in the fields mapping of that step.\n\nMultiple datatrees available when configuring a recipe step\nData pills example\nFor instance, let's take the scenario where we wish to send out a simple welcome email to every new Salesforce lead who has signed up for our mailing list. The following is that recipe.\n\nRecipe that sends a welcome email to new Salesforce leads Example recipe\nIn the Send email action, pills from the New Salesforce lead datatree have been mapped into the input fields.\n\nExample of data pills being mapped into an action step\nAs these pills are variables, they will only have a value when a trigger event is picked up by the recipe - in this case, when a new lead is created in Salesforce. For example, if a new lead called Madison Diaz with the email address madisondiaz82@gmail.com is created, the recipe will pick it up and promptly send an email to the address madisondiaz82@gmail.com with the message:\nHi Madison,\n\nThanks for joining our mailing list! We're excited to have you!\nSample schema\nWhen your app is connected to Workato, sample schema pulled from it will show up in the datatree next to the data pills, to provide examples how what this data is in your app.\n\nOutput datatree for New Salesforce account trigger\nData types\nWorkato supports various data types:\n\nString\nInteger\nNumber\nDate\nDatetime\nBoolean\n\n"},"recipes/mapping.html":{"url":"recipes/mapping.html","title":"Mapping","keywords":"","body":"Fields mapping\nFields mapping is what we call inserting variables (datapills) or constants into input fields. This gives you control over what data moves from an app to another app.\nFields mapping is usually more relevant for actions as opposed to triggers, as we define data flows from the triggers or from previous steps into subsequent steps. In every step, we have to get data pills (variables) from the previous steps' datatrees and map them into the step's input fields. In this way, we're crafting a template that determines data flow in your recipe.\nFields mapping example\nIn the following example, we map the Account Name data pill from the Salesforce New account trigger into the Message input field in the Send email action.\n\nMapping the account name data pill into the message input field\nMapping constants VS mapping variables\nWorkato supports mapping of both constants and variables.\nMapping variables\nThe variable Account name has been mapped to the Name input field. This means that for every new Salesforce account that is created, the account name of this Salesforce account will be used as the organization name of the Zendesk organization that will be created. For example, a new Salesforce account named Sattei Winery will in turn create a Zendesk organization named Sattei Winery.\n\nInput field with variable mapping\nMapping constants\nOn the other hand, the input field Notes has a constant mapped to it - the words \"Synced over from Salesforce.\" This means that all newly created Zendesk organizations created via Workato will have the words \"Synced over from Salesforce.\" in its Notes field.\n\nInput field with constant mapping\nHere's an example of the new Zendesk organization created via the above mapping:\n\nNewly created Zendesk organization Sattei Winery\nMapping both constants and variables\nOf course, you can also combine constants and variables in the input fields for the data you wish to have.\nData transformation\nThe data that an app holds doesn't always transfer easily to another app, for example:\n\nyour sales app stores names by full name, but your marketing app requires first name, middle name and last name\nyour ecommerce app stores addresses as individual fields, e.g. address line 1, address line 2, city, state, but your accounting app simply requires a single billing address and shipping address field\nthe priority levels in your ticketing app may be low, medium, high, but in your sales system they're low, normal, urgent\n\nIn such cases, you need to work with the data from the source app and transform it into a suitable format for the target app. Workato supports data transformation via its formulas.\nData transformation via formula example\nIn the following example, we're using a ternary formula in formula mode to decide what value to pass into the input field Message. The formula is in this format:\n[condition] ? [do this if true] : [do this if false]\nTherefore, we're checking to see if there is any value in the Full name pill. If yes, we pass in Full name into the input field. If not, we pass in First name into the input field.\n\nCommon issues when mapping fields\nHere are some of the common errors we've experienced when it comes to fields mapping\n\nData pills with no values at run-time for required fields\n\nAt design-time (when we're building the recipe), all required fields are supposed to be mapped. The recipe will refuse to start and throw an error if a required field is left empty.\nHowever, even if an input field has been mapped at design-time, it might not actually have a value at run-time (when a trigger event comes in and a job is being processed). In such a case, that specific job will throw an error and fail.\nYou would need to decide how to handle such cases whereby a required field might not receive a value at run-time. If that is rightly a business logic error which needs to be resolved, e.g. the recipe tries to move a new lead from a sales app to a marketing app, but finds that it's missing an email address for the lead, the answer might be to let the job fail and flag the employee who had created the lead record.\n\nData pills from the wrong datatree\n\nWhen mapping input fields with data pills, it is common to find pills with the same names in the datatrees, e.g. if you're moving customers from an app to another, customer datatrees tend to hold address information. Hence you might find yourself using a pill with the right name, e.g. City, State, Country, but from the wrong datatree.\n\nData pills from the wrong part of the recipe\nIf your recipe has conditional steps, e.g. if customer is present, update customer record, and if customer is not present, create customer record, then for each job that's processed, there will be steps that are not carried out. In such cases, the values in the datatree for these steps will most likely be blank.\n\nIf you're using data pills from these steps, you need to recognize the potential of these pills being null, and handle that scenario.\n"},"recipes/version-management.html":{"url":"recipes/version-management.html","title":"Recipe version management","keywords":"","body":"Recipe version management\nEvery time a recipe is saved, a version of the recipe is saved.

Make sure your trigger works as expected\n Things to check when using a trigger :\n\nShould you be using trigger filters?\nIs the Since parameter correct? \nShould it be based on created/updated, or just created?\nI start the recipe with nothing but the trigger followed by a clock action. The clock action is just a dummy action. When I test this recipe, it will get a current time. This way, I can check whether the tested output is the desired result that I wish. I am able to do all this without updating records in any of my connected apps.\n\n\n\n2. Check your conditional actions\n You can now add a few more steps to make sure which condition would be the best choice, I use clock, email, or Slack in place of the real actions to capture the data mappings that will eventually be there..The reason for adding these notification steps here is that conditional steps do not show up in the log, hence we need to add different actions for different conditions to know if the conditions are correct.\n \n Best if you have both sides to know which is the better course to take.\n3. Pay Attention to indentation\n Make sure that your actions are all nested correctly. For Conditional actions and repeated actions, actions that you want to be processed under those criteria have to be nested under the first action. If an action is supposed to be activated under a certain condition, make sure that it is nested under the same scope. If it isn't, it will be processed regardless of the condition.\n  \n This is wrong because Step 2 is not indented. Note how Step 4 is on a different level from the rest. Step 4 is indented under Step 3.\n4. Cloning and Version Control\n  I use cloning and modifying to create the next version of the recipe. Cloning recipe allows me to push changes to the original recipe whenever I want to. This allows you to create a \"test\" and \"production\" recipes. The cloned recipe will be a production recipe, and you can make changes on the original/test recipe. \n![iterative_tip_4_1](/assets/images/building-best-practices/iterative_tip_4_1.png)\n\nWhen you edit the original recipe, the cloned recipe will show that changes are available to be pushed.\n\n![iterative_tip_4_2](/assets/images/building-best-practices/iterative_tip_4_2.png)\n\nSimply click on install to copy the changes from test recipe to production recipe\n Once you are satisfied with the changes, going to the cloned recipe, you should be able to see a note that a new version is available. This allows you to push any changes made on the test recipe to the production recipe. \nVersion Control Guide\nIf you have made any unwanted changes to your recipe and want to revert back to a previous version, just follow this guide!\nFirst, got to the recipe page and look under the Description tab. Under the tab, you should see the current version of the recipe, with the View History link next to it. \n Click on the View History page, and you should see something like this\n  \n Click on a version that you would like to revert to or just take a look at, and you see a page with the details of that version of the recipe.\n   \n Once you are satisfied that this is the version that you want to revert to, click on the  button and voila! You have reverted your recipe to a previous version!\n5. Cleaning up\n I keep iteratively building up the recipe, until I get to my perfect recipe. After I am done, I go and cleanup all the temporary recipes I had built that I don't need any more. To delete, you click on the Delete Button underneath the 'Start Recipe' Button.\n\n6. Try out the new recipe.\nAt this point will connect to the production system by changing the App connection to point to the production app. I will try out the recipe by changing the since parameter to a very short interval, and add a new record and test it out. I may do this step iteratively too, by updating  the test system first and then change the connections to make the updates to the production system.\nThe final step is to make a copy of the recipe and change the since parameter to the right interval. You will need to make a copy of the recipe as changing the since parameter to an earlier time does not trigger the recipe to go back before the latest trigger than was made. You may also need to change the connections to your production systems.\nClick on start to start the recipe. You are done. If there are any errors you will be notified by email. \n7. Monitor\nIf you want to you can monitor the recipe periodically to see if there are any errors that you had not taken care of. You can do this on the 'My recipes page' that shows the active recipes and the failed and successful job counts.\nNaming Your Recipes\nWhen we are in a rush to get our recipe up and running it seems like a chore to pay attention to the name or description for the recipe, but giving it a proper name and describing it properly goes a long way when you have many recipes. Different people have different styles, and we will mention some that we follow\nNaming\n\nUsing the name of the main apps in the recipe name. I used to name them as [SFDC+QBO] New account in Salesforce... I still use this sometime so I can quickly spot them or sort them when I am dealing with them outside the system. I keep a separate log of my recipes in a spreadsheet for my own cataloging purposes and naming it this way sometimes helps\n\nSome people put in their name in front or some other prefix like [RD] New customer from Salesforce.... or [Prod] New customer from Salesforce etc.\n\nTo use the 'New recipe' prefix or not. Some people use the New recipe prefix while they are building the recipe, and when they have a successful recipe, change that to the intended name and delete the trial ones. They can easily track and delete the trial ones because of the 'New recipe' pre-fix.\n\n\nClones\n\nIf you clone a recipe from some other user, your recipe gets the same name as the original. Keep in mind that when the original changes you don't get notified or updated.\n\nCopies\n\nWhen you copy your own recipe, you will get a name that starts with 'Copy of' .... This is to avoid having duplicate names, however it does not really matter to the system because the unique identifier for a recipe is the recipe number. You can see the recipe number in the recipe link. For example, the recipe number for the recipe displayed below is 13582. You can always get to a recipe by keying in the address as www.workato.com/recipes/[recipe number here]. This works for all public recipes, but not for private recipes.\n\n*The URL to search for this recipe would be: www.workato.com/recipes/13582\n\n\nAdding Descriptions and Comments on your Recipes\nRecipe Descriptions\nWe like recipe builders to describe their recipes well. This is because we built Workato as a community for building and sharing recipes and we want to make the recipes easy for sharing. When someone else is looking at your recipe, they will see the definition on top and decide if they want to look further down or not. \nComments\nWe also recommend adding comments to your recipe steps, especially if the steps are not obvious. To attach comments, you click on the comment button, that is the first button on the right hand set of buttons/icons. If you click on it, a Comment window opens up underneath.\n To learn how to add comments and descriptions to your recipes, watch this video.\n"},"recipes/running-recipes.html":{"url":"recipes/running-recipes.html","title":"Running recipes","keywords":"","body":""},"recipes/jobs.html":{"url":"recipes/jobs.html","title":"Jobs","keywords":"","body":"Jobs\nJobs are a single run of the recipe, and refer to a trigger event that is picked up by the recipe and processed through the recipe steps.\nJob statuses\nJobs can have the following statuses:\n\nCompleted\n\nCompleted indicates that the job has ended without getting an error.\n\nPending\n\nPending indicates that the job is still being processed, or waiting for something, e.g. Scheduler's Wait action will wait for a specified period of time, while People Task's Request task approval action will wait for the reviewer to respond or the task to expire.\n\nFailed\n\nFailed indicates that the job has ended unexpectedly because of an error. Such jobs may create incomplete records in your apps as it failed before it could manage to complete its run.\n\nAborted\n\nAborted is a rare state that a job gets into if it had been pending when the recipe was stopped and changed in a manner that affects those jobs (i.e. if we changed steps that the job had already carried out). Because the recipe logic has changed, any pending jobs will be aborted.\nJobs report\nEvery recipe has a jobs report that shows a high-level view of processed jobs. Clicking on a single job brings you into a detailed job history that shows step-level execution data flows.\n\nJobs report page\nYou can find out more about jobs reports here.\nRerunning jobs\nWhen a job fails, it can be reran easily once the issues causing its failure has been remedied.

The entire flow of each trigger event through the recipe is called a job.\nInformation such as date, time processed and job IDs, can be found here. The following shows the default jobs report page.\n\nNon-customized, default jobs report page\nCustomized jobs report\nJobs report can be further customized to show the relevant information for the jobs processed, as seen in the following.\n\nCustomized jobs report page\nTo cuztomize your jobs report, go to the Jobs tab and click on 'Customize report' next to the Rerun and Refresh buttons.\n\nYou can use data pills from any datatrees in your recipe for the column values. After a job has been processed, the relevant data will show up in the custom jobs report. In the example below, the custom jobs report contains the Xero invoice ID, Infusionsoft invoice ID, as well as payment and contact information. It is good practice to customize the job report to be able to easily identify jobs.\n\nJob details\nFrom the jobs report, you can view detailed information about each job as well as step-level information. This is useful in several ways:\n\nDebugging your recipe\n\nIn the early stages of testing a recipe, jobs may show up as completed in the jobs report, but they might not be processed in the manner you expect - taking a look at the exact steps processed by the recipe will help in ensuring the recipe is processing jobs in the expected workflow.\n\nTroubleshooting your job errors\nIf jobs fail, you can take a look at the run-time data to understand why the job failed at specific step it failed at.\n\nTo view a job's details, simply click on the job you are interested in seeing.\n\nEach line of the report gives the details of one job. A job is shown in this report every time the recipe is triggered, whether complete, pending or with error.\nHow to read the job report\nThe general details of the job are displayed on the top of the job report. This includes the Status of the job, it's Description, the date and time this job Started at and was Completed, and the recipe version with which this job ran.\n\nBelow these details, you should see the recipe's steps that were run in this job. Click on each line to see what data was used in the step.\nInput\nThe input is the data used as specified on the action in the recipe.\nFor example, in this search step, which uses the specific string \"Xero Invoice + Invoice Number to search for an order title, the input contains the string and the number of the invoice used in this job.\n\nOutput\nThe output is the information is found from the specific input. In this case, the invoice number used yielded the following information:\n\nLooking at the output in the steps can tell you vital information about why a job has failed. Often, the output used in a specific step may be empty, thus using the data pills from that step in a later part of the recipe will not yield anything.\nErrors\nWhen the job throws an error, view which step this occurs at and the error details on this page. The step with the error is indicated with a red line.\n\nFor-each Loops\nConditional Actions\nIn conditional actions, there is only an \"Output\" tab. The output will have one of two values: \"True\" or \"False\" which determines whether the nested actions will take place.\nWhen the value is \"False\", the nested actions will be skipped and the recipe proceeds to the next possible action.\n\nWhen the value is \"True\", the nested actions will be completed.\n\n"},"recipes/start-and-stop.html":{"url":"recipes/start-and-stop.html","title":"Start and stop","keywords":"","body":"Starting & Stopping Recipes\nStarting Recipes\nAfter successfully testing your recipes, start running them to automate your workflows. Click on 'Start recipe' and allow the recipe to run continually in the background. \nThe 'Start recipe' button should be available to you by default after you have run at least 1 test. If you wish to start the recipe before testing, the button is available in the dropdown beside 'Test recipe'.\n\nAfter you have started the recipe, the recipe becomes an 'Active' recipe. On your Home page, you can filter by active recipes to see all the recipes currently running.\nConfiguring the Administrator Email\nWhen any errors that occur in the active recipes, an email will be sent to the Notifications Email you specify in the Account Settings. To add/change this email, click on your account name on the top right of your screen > Settings. \n\nGo to the 'Contact' tab to change the Notifications Email.\n\nStopping Recipes\nWhen do I stop my recipes?\n\nStop the recipes when they are no longer relevant. You can only delete recipes after they have been stopped. \nYou should also stop the recipes that are running into constant errors or if you notice incorrect data passing into your applications as a result of the recipe and fix these errors.\nWhy are my recipes automatically stopped?\nThere are 2 reasons for this: \n\nYou have reached your monthly transaction limit. Recipes are automatically stopped when the transaction limit is hit. Contact our Customer Success team to add more transactions. You may also wait till the start of the new cycle when the monthly transactions are restored.\n\nThere are more than 60 consecutive trigger errors. This error message appears on the top of the recipe when you try to start it.\nWhen you receive this error message on your recipe, it means the recipe failed to trigger for more than 60 jobs. In this case, view the error message provided and fix the errors before starting the recipe again.\n\n\n\nWhat happens when I start a stopped recipe?\nStarting a stopped recipe will pick up jobs from where it last stopped. \nFor example, if I stopped my recipe on January 1st, 10:30pm, and start it again on January 10th, 7pm, it will begin picking up jobs from January 1st, 10:31pm onwards. \nIf you wish for the recipe to only start picking up new jobs from January 10th onwards, copy the recipe and change the 'From' date. The 'copy' button is below the recipe name. \n\n"},"recipes/testing-recipes.html":{"url":"recipes/testing-recipes.html","title":"Test recipe","keywords":"","body":"Testing Recipes\nWhy is testing recipes necessary?\nTesting recipes is a good practice. Workato is moving data and information from one business app to the other via the workflow described in recipes. Testing these workflows is critical to ensure that the information entered into the apps by Workato is accurate and does not include bad data. \nGood Practices\nUsing Sandbox Instances\nIf the application used provides sandbox accounts, they are recommended for testing recipes. This is to ensure no bad data is entered into the Production accounts until the recipe is properly configured and tested.\nAdding 'Stops' to prevent unwanted actions from happening\nAdd a 'Stop' to the recipe when testing if the actions that follow are not needed. Click the '+' button below the last step in the recipe and drag it to the correct place.\n\nFor example, if the last step in the recipe updates a record in the application that is not needed, adding a Stop above it will prevent this. This saves time in correcting the data that has changed in the applications.\nTest with all possible scenarios\nRecipes often come with multiple lines of conditional logic (i.e. IF this then that). \nIn these situations, test the recipe with all possible scenarios to ensure the pills are properly mapped and logic properly defined in the recipe. Doing these tests will save time fixing erroneous data after starting your recipe.\nRecipe Testing Basics\nRecipes built on Workato can vary greatly in complexity. Building and running a 1-line recipe may be simple and straightforward, but as the recipe grows more intricate, understanding how to test and ensure the recipe is built correctly is vital.\nHaving a Trigger Event\nA trigger event is what Workato is looking out for in the application specified in the trigger. For example, if the trigger is \"New invoice in QuickBooks\", as shown below, there has to be invoices in the QuickBooks account for the test to work. Trigger events should be created prior to testing the recipe, and not when the 'Test Recipe' button is clicked. \n\nChanging the 'From' parameter for testing\nChanging the 'From' parameter is critical to testing. If test events have already been created in the application, the 'From' parameter has to be adjusted to allow the recipe to pick up jobs from the correct time. \n\nTriggers for applications do not have the 'From' parameter. In applications like these, jobs will be picked up from the time the recipe is started.\nNote: The 'From' parameter cannot be changed once the recipe has been tested or started. Copy the recipe by clicking on the 'Copy' button below the recipe name and change the 'From' parameter.\n\nThere are 2 ways to change the 'From' parameter. \nList Values\nSome values are provided in the dropdown: Recipe start, Half an hour ago, An hour ago, Yesterday, Last week, Last month and Beginning of time. \n\nFor testing, it is recommended that this is set to at least half an hour or an hour ago to ensure there are jobs for testing. \nInput Custom Value\nIf there is a more specific date and time that Workato should begin picking up trigger events from, click on the the dropdown arrow next to 'From' to change the input method.\n\nChoose 'Enter custom value' and click on the Calendar icon to choose a date and time.\n\nTest Recipe vs. Start Recipe\nThe 'Test Recipe' button is the default button when the recipe has not been run. The 'Start Recipe' button can be accessed via the dropdown as shown below:\n\nThe 'Test Recipe' button is highly recommended, especially if there are many trigger events in the application. Test Recipe picks up only the first trigger job that it finds and run through it. Once that has been processed, the recipe will stop. Then, check what has been done for this specific record in the 'Jobs' tab. \n'Start Recipe' will find all these events that are applicable and start processing them. If there are many trigger events, they will be picked up and run. It is important to test the recipe first and ensure it is running correctly before clicking on 'Start recipe'. \nUnderstanding the Job Report\nAfter clicking on 'Test recipe', check the 'Jobs' tab to see what has run. Any errors that have occurred during the tests will show up in the job report with a red warning logo. Click on the job to see a detailed breakdown of the error.\n\nIf there is no red logo, the job is successful. During the testing phase, click on the description to see if the job has completed as expected because the job may have stopped at a conditional stop action as shown below. There might be other steps that were expected to complete. If so, there may be an error in the logic of the recipe that needs fixing.\nFinding the Error\nThe step where the error occurred is highlighted with a red line. Click on the step with the error to see the error details.\n\nIn this case, the error occurs in step 12. Click on the 'Error' tab to see the error details.\n \nHead back to the recipe to fix the incorrect step or to the application to see if there is incorrect data in the fields involved.\nFixing the Error\nRe-running jobs are the easiest way to test the recipe after fixing the errors. Check the box next to the job to be rerun and click on the rerun button.\n\nStarting the recipe\nAfter testing and ensuring the recipe works, start the recipe. The recipe will now run in the background and consistently check for trigger events. In case of an error, an email will be sent to the address specified in the Account Settings.\n"},"recipes/rerun-job.html":{"url":"recipes/rerun-job.html","title":"Rerun job","keywords":"","body":"Rerunning Jobs\nWhen do I need to rerun a job?\nRe-running a job will cause the trigger event to be passed through the recipe again, and this feature is useful in the cases below:\n\nTesting a new recipe\nWhen there are errors encountered\n\nNote: Duplicates may occur when jobs are rerun, so be sure to check and remove duplicates (if present) before re-running the job.\nTesting a new recipe\nMany times, during testing, people incrementally build and test a recipe with the same job. During the testing phase, rerunning jobs is commonly used to fix the errors encountered in recipes. \nRather than creating new trigger events, rerunning the same job will allow you to fix the errors 1 step at a time with the same event.\nErrors\nWhen an error is detected in your recipes, an email will be sent to the Notifications email address specified in the Account Settings. The job will be incomplete and data may be missing from the application as certain steps in the recipe were not completed. \nThus, rerunning the job is necessary to ensure the job runs to completion as specified in the recipe.\nYou can view all the errors in the 'Jobs' tab and filtering the report. \n\nNo fixing of the recipe is required\n If you face the following errors, rerun your job and the job should complete: \n\nConnection errors: These are intermittent issues that result from connection issues with the applications connected to the recipe. \n\nErrors that need fixing\nWhen the error is different from the ones listed above, or if rerunning the jobs do not work, the recipe or data from the application needs to be fixed.\nIn the job report, look at the error code provided and make the changes accordingly. \nWhat does rerunning a job do?\nEssentially, rerunning a job uses the same trigger event and runs the job from start to finish. \nNote: As a previously run job may have run through steps that have created objects in the applications, rerunning the job may cause errors as these objects already exist. Thus, ensure that objects created by previously run jobs have been deleted before rerunning.\nHow to rerun a job\nJobs Tab\nNavigate to the 'Jobs' tab and to see a list of jobs that have been run. You can filter the jobs by 'Completed', 'Pending' and 'Failed'. \nCompleted jobs are those that have successfully run through the recipe while failed jobs met with errors that stopped the job before it could be completed. \nCheck the boxes on the left of each line and click 'Rerun'. You can rerun 10 jobs (1 page of jobs) at a time. \n\nJob Report\nThe rerun job button is located on the top right hand corner of the job report page. Click on this to rerun the job and you will be re-directed to the 'Jobs' tab.\n\nRerun History\nAll rerun jobs have a history log at the bottom of the job details page. Click on each line to view the previously run jobs. \n\nData retention policy\nData retention applies to processed trigger events. This means that older jobs might not be able to be reran.

The following sample CSV file will be used as the example list.\nManufacturer, Model, Category, Item Name, Item Code, Description, Unit Cost, Unit Price, Taxable, Tax, Custom Field 1, Custom Field 2, Custom Field 3\nSierra Gardening, MS-321, Gardening supplies, Pine wood potting bench, MS-321, Oakwood potting bench, 74.50, 119.99, Yes, 0.0875, Pine, White, 30 inches\nSierra Gardening, MS-322, Gardening supplies, Cherry wood potting bench, MS-322, Oakwood potting bench, 74.50, 119.99, Yes, 0.0875, Cherry, Natural, 30 inches\nSierra Gardening, MS-323, Gardening supplies, Cedar wood potting bench, MS-323, Oakwood potting bench, 74.50, 119.99, Yes, 0.0875, Cedar, Black, 30 inches\nIn most of the examples, the Box trigger New CSV file will be used to read this CSV file from a Box folder and parse it to Workato as a list of three CSV lines. Create a CSV file with the above CSV sample and upload into a specific Box folder for the New CSV file trigger to pick up.\nIf the above CSV file is the only CSV file in the selected Box folder in the trigger configuration, the fields list will be populated automatically with the column names. The column names has to correspond exactly with the header line in the CSV file in order for the CSV data to be mapped accurately to their columns.\n\nDefining the expected columns in the CSV files that the recipe will pick up Example recipe\nThe columns defined in the Box new CSV file trigger shows up as a list of usable variables in the output datatree. These variables can be used to map into subsequent recipe steps.\n\nRow of CSV columns in the trigger output datatree\nNotice the row icon in the datatree. This identifies lists in the datatree.\n\nList icon within datatree\nThese datapills can be used to map into Workato actions' input fields. There are three ways to map datapills from lists:\n\ndirectly into an action without list processing\ninto an action with a list input (action handles list processing implicitly)\ninto an action with a Repeat step (action does not handle list processing, list processing needs to be done explicitly at the recipe logic level)\n\nUsing datapills from lists\nUsing datapills directly in an action without list processing\nWhen using pills directly from a list, only the values of the first list item will be retrieved. In the following recipe, pills from the list are used directly in the Log message action.\nRecipe using list pills directly in Log message action\n  Example recipe\n\nField mappings for Log message action\nIn the job details page, the trigger output displays all three lines within the CSV file.\n\nTrigger output details displaying lines within the CSV file\nAs the Log message action uses only datapills directly from the list, without handling the list in any way, only the first line's data is retrieved.\n\nLog message input displaying only the first line of data\nUsing datapills in an action with a list input (action handles list processing implicitly)\nSome actions will accept a list as input e.g. Salesforce bulk insert and bulk update actions, create journal entry actions for accounting apps, create sales order actions for ERP apps.\nThe following is an example scenario that imports new products from a Box CSV file into Salesforce via the Bulk insert action.\n\nExample recipe using list input Example recipe\nActions that take lists as inputs will have a input field called Source list, which will only take in list pills. When these list input fields are selected, the datatree changes to offer only list pills. The Rows list object pill is mapped into the Salesforce product source list input field.\n\nRows list object is mapped into the Salesforce products input source list\nFor the list object passed into the input source list, the list will be transferred from the source app to the target app, with the values being trasnferred based on the fields mapped in the recipe. The three inventory items will be moved from Box into Salesforce as products.\n\nMapping of list datapills to list input\nThe following shows the CSV file content.\n\nTrigger output details displaying lines within the CSV file\nThe action output in the job history shows that three products have been created accordingly in Salesforce.\n\nSalesforce bulk insert via list input\nUsing datapills in an action with a Repeat step (action does not handle list processing, list processing needs to be done explicitly at the recipe logic level)\nIn this example scenario, let's import a list of new inventory items (recorded within a CSV file just uploaded into Box) into a NetSuite instance. There is a list to read from with the Box connector's New CSV file trigger, but no list processing capabilities in the NetSuite connector's Add inventory item action.\nIn order to move through the list and create three NetSuite inventory items, the Repeat step should be used to iterate through the list, and carry out the same action for each iteration.\n Example recipe\nTo iterate through the Rows list, pass the Rows list object as input for the repeat step. The recipe will therefore iterate through the list thrice to repeat the \"Add inventory item\" action thrice, with different values from different CSV lines each time.\n\nProvide the list object as input for repeat step\nWhen using the Repeat step, the important thing to note is to retrieve datapills from the For each datatree.\n\nMapping datapills from the Foreach datatree\nThis ensures that, when the list is being iterated through, the first Add inventory item step uses the first line:\nSierra Gardening, MS-321, Gardening supplies, Pine wood potting bench, MS-321, Oakwood potting bench, 74.50, 119.99, Yes, 0.0875, Pine, White, 30 inches\nThe second Add inventory item step uses the second line:\nSierra Gardening, MS-322, Gardening supplies, Cherry wood potting bench, MS-322, Oakwood potting bench, 74.50, 119.99, Yes, 0.0875, Cherry, Natural, 30 inches\nAnd the third Add inventory item step uses the third line:\nSierra Gardening, MS-323, Gardening supplies, Cedar wood potting bench, MS-323, Oakwood potting bench, 74.50, 119.99, Yes, 0.0875, Cedar, Black, 30 inches\nCommon mistake when using Repeat step\nAs discussed here, using pills directly from the list object in the datatree without list handling will result in the first list item being used. Hence, if datapills from the list object (instead of datapills from the Repeat step) are used inside the Repeat step, the recipe still iterates through the 3 CSV lines, but instead of using values from each line with every iteration, only values from the first line will be used for all 3 iterations, resulting in duplication.\n\nExample of a recipe with wrong direct mapping from list instead of from the Repeat step (Example recipe)\nList connector (Accumulator)\nThe list connector is a Workato utility built for users to create custom lists and store data in the list for the duration of a job, to be used in the same job. It is usually used for users to prepare a list to write to an action with a list input.\nUsing the accumulator action to create a custom list\nDefining the list fields\nA custom list has to be created before data can be accumulated and stored within it. To create the list, select the List connector and its default action \nAppend item to list.\n\nAccumulator with no fields configured\nDefine the fields in the custom list by configuring field name, type and hint.\n\nAdding a string field to the accumulator list\n\nAdding a date field to the accumulator list\nAfter configuring the fields in the custom list, ensure that the list is within a Repeat step and that the datapills are mapped from the Repeat step's output datatree. This ensures that the iterated list items' values are mapped into the custom list accordingly, and that values are not being duplicated within the list because the wrong pills from the main datatree (as opposed to the Repeat step's datatree) were mapped as shown above.\n\nConfigured and mapped accumulator\nFields can be added or edited within custom lists anytime.\n\nFields can be added or edited in custom lists\nThe custom list can also be edited via its JSON representation.\n\nEditing the custom list's JSON representation\nExample recipes that use accumulator, list input and Repeat step\nLet's take the scenario whereby closed won Salesforce opportunities with a list of opportunity products need to be moved into NetSuite as sales orders with a similar list of line items.\nThe NetSuite connector's Create sales order action takes in a list of line items that reference the inventory items' internal NetSuite ID. This means that users similarly need to have a list of NetSuite inventory item IDs to create the NetSuite sales order in a single action. However, from Salesforce, only Salesforce opportunity products' IDs are available. In order to obtain the NetSuite inventory items' internal IDs, users would have to search for the correct NetSuite inventory item by its Salesforce opportunity product name, and then pass the NetSuite internal ID of the found NetSuite inventory item into the Create sales order action.\nThere are two ways of building this recipe:\n1) Using accumulator + list input. Iteratively build a custom list of NetSuite inventory items from the Saleforce opportunity product list, then create the complete NetSuite sales order with lines in a single action\nIterate through the Salesforce list of opportunity products via a Repeat step to find corresponding NetSuite inventory items, and accumulate that in a custom list. Subsequently, create a complete NetSuite sales order with a list of line items in a single action, by passing in the custom list built with accumulator.\n\nSalesforce-Netsuite recipe using Repeat step Example recipe\n2) Using Repeat step.

Simply select the intervals at which you wish for the recipe to run. This is usually best for monitoring-related use cases, such as checking how whether or not your customer service messages are being processed quickly enough (are there more than X unattended conversations in the last hour?). You can also set the time you want the recipe to start running using \"Start at\".\nScheduled tasks\nScheduled tasks are triggered at specific times. For instance, we might like our recipe to be triggered at 1:15pm every Monday and Tuesday. First, select the \"Scheduled task\" trigger, and then add the \"Hour\" optional field.\n\nIn the \"Hour\" field, fill in 13.\nIn the \"Minute\" field, fill in 15.\nChoose your time zone.\nChoose \"yes\" for Monday and Tuesday, and \"no\" for the rest.\nNow, the recipe will run at 1:15pm every Monday and Tuesday.\n\nWhat happens if I don't fill in the \"Hour\" field?\nIn that case, your recipe will run at MM minutes, every hour of every day specified. In this example, on Monday and Tuesday, the recipe would be triggered at 0015, 0115, etc.\nActions\nGet current time\nThis can be used to get the time at which a certain step was performed, and can be useful when you need to input a time stamp of a task \nWait\nThe wait action enables a recipe wait for a set amount of time between steps. This is especially useful to ensure a recipe is using the most updated data in your mapping. \nHow to use Scheduler to test recipes\nYou can use scheduler to test recipe by using it as a dummy trigger or dummy action. This is useful when you want to determine which action in a recipe is causing problems as you don't need to keep repeating a trigger event (e.g. creating a new salesforce lead over and over). Simply create a recipe with the trigger as scheduler, and set up the action(s) that you want to test. Alternatively, if you need to test if a trigger is working properly, you can use scheduler as a dummy action so that the recipe can be started.\n"},"features/utilities.html":{"url":"features/utilities.html","title":"Utility","keywords":"","body":"\nUtilities\nWorkato's Utilities connector is useful for performing all sorts of tasks\nHere are the list of actions you can perform using \n\nCreate list\n\nDownload file from URL\n\nGenerate column chart\n\nGenerate pie chart\n\nLink two objects\n\nGet linked object\n\n\nCreate list\nIn workato, to use the repeat action requires a List item to be present. However there may be some instances where you may want to repeat an action a specific number of times. To do so, you can use the  Create list action to create a list with a predetermined size (up to 500) to use the repeat action. \nFirst, create the create list action, and determine the size you want to use \nNext, you can create a repeat action any time after the Create list action. Then, use the list pill from the create list step's output in the Input list field. Once you have configured your recipe, it will repeat the set of actions the same number of times as the size of the list.\nDownload file from URL\nDownloading a file in a recipe allows you to use that file later in the recipe, usually to upload onto another app. However, downloaded text content can be used directly into the recipe. Downloading a file does not mean that you will see that file on your computer. It is merely download for use in a recipe. Take note the maximum file size you can download is 25MB. \nIn the Download file from URL section, you can provide a static URL if you intend to upload the same file to multiple places, (e.g. as an attachment to all Accounts in Salesforce) or provide a dynamic URL by using a URL pill obtained from a previous step output. You may also choose if you want your download file content to be encoded using base64. \nGenerate column chart\nUsing this action allows you to use data from two columns in a list to create a column chart to help visualize and analyze data better. Select a list from your recipe's app data, followed by 2 columns from the list.

In addition, Workato also has the capability to handle batch processing, e.g. moving 50 new Salesforce leads into Marketo in a single job.\nBatch processing is useful when moving large volumes of data. It is supported in certain connectors, such as database connectors (SQL Server, MySQL, etc.), cloud storage connectors that works with CSV files (e.g. Box, Amazon S3), Salesforce connector, etc.\nBatch triggers\nBatch triggers are similar to polling triggers in fetching the same records. However, where polling triggers have trigger events corresponding to a single record, batch triggers have trigger events corresponding to a list of records. Maximum batch size can usually be defined in the trigger configuration.\nBatch trigger example\nThe Salesforce batch trigger has a default value of 100. In this case, each trigger event will contain a list of maximum 100 account records.\n\nBatch trigger with a batch size of 100\nThe job details for each trigger event will contain the specific details of only the first and last record in the list.\n\nJob details - trigger output for a batch of new accounts in Salesforce\nAs the batch trigger polls at a regular basis, each poll may fetch more or less than the batch size defined in the trigger. For example, when the following recipe was first started, 843 records were fetched from 1 Jan 2015, midnight PST. These records were broken up into 8 trigger events of 100 records each, and 1 trigger event of 43 records. The next poll, 5 minutes later, fetched only 2 new account records created.\n\nCustom job report displaying account batches' details - names of first and last accounts in the batch, as well as batch size\nBatch actions\nBatch actions are typically of the form Create batch or Update batch or Upsert batch. Accordingly, these actions create a list of new records, update a list of existing records, or upsert (create if record doesn't exist, update if record exists) a list of records.\nBatch create actions\nBatch create actions create multiple records in a single action (typically corresponding to a single API call). Batch create actions usually accept a list of records as input, therefore typically recipes will:\n\nmove a list of records from source app to target app, or\nprepare a list of records via building and accumulating data in a custom list, then moving that prepared list into the target app\n\nBatch create action example\nThe following is an example scenario that imports new products from a Box CSV file into Salesforce via the Bulk insert action.\n\nExample recipe using list input Example recipe\nActions that take lists as inputs will have a input field called Source list, which will only take in list pills. When these list input fields are selected, the datatree changes to offer only list pills. The Rows list object pill is mapped into the Salesforce product source list input field.\n\nRows list object is mapped into the Salesforce products input source list\nFor the list object passed into the input source list, the list will be transferred from the source app to the target app, with the values being trasnferred based on the fields mapped in the recipe. The three inventory items will be moved from Box into Salesforce as products.\n\nMapping of list datapills to list input\nThe following shows the CSV file content.\n\nTrigger output details displaying lines within the CSV file\nThe action output in the job history shows that three products have been created accordingly in Salesforce.\n\nSalesforce bulk insert via list input\n"},"features/lookup-tables.html":{"url":"features/lookup-tables.html","title":"Lookup tables","keywords":"","body":"Lookup tables\nThe primary reason for lookup tables (also termed as cross reference tables) is to enable fast and easy lookup of frequently used data that are static and immutable. \nSome of examples of such data include:\n\nGiven a city name, you want to get the zip code \nConversion from metric to SI for distances \nGiven a department, rank, retrieve vacation accrual rate\n\nLookup tables is currently only available to Business plans and up.\nLimits\nYou cannot have more than 5000 entries in one lookup table\nWe support only 5 columns. Each column can be used as a key to lookup the entry\nHow to setup your lookup tables\nThere are two ways your recipes can upload data from your lookup tables:\n\nBy importing an existing CSV file \nBy adding new entries via a recipe\n\nNote: Lookup tables are immutable and the existing entries cannot be modified or deleted.\nImporting an existing CSV file\nThe GIF below walks you through the process of creating a lookup table and loading it with data imported from a CSV file.\n\nYou can also manually enter additional rows from the UI.\n\n\nYou can select what columns you choose to view. At present we support only 5 columns.\n\nAdding new entries via a recipe\nThere is a special connector called ‘Lookup table’ that allows you to work with your tables. This connectors support these actions\n\nLookup entry\nSearch entries\nAdd entry\n\n1. Lookup entry\nAs the name suggests, data is typically organized like in a database table columns and rows of data. You can then lookup any row by one or more columns. You can lookup an entry within the specified lookup table by using\n\nAny column\nMultiple columns\nIn the example below, all 4 available columns are displayed. It returns the first entry based on the column value provide. \n\n\nThis GIF walks you through the entire flow:\n\n2. Search entries\nWorks similar to lookup, except that it will return all matched entries. It returns a list.\n3. Add entry\nAdd a new entry to an existing lookup table. Great for reading a data source and creating a lookup table based on it. E.g. read titles from your HR apps and create a title lookup table.\n\nHow to use Lookup Table Formulas\nNow that you have a lookup table set up, you need to configure your recipe to obtain data from one column of the table when data from another column is fed in. To do so, simply use the lookup formula. Simply set any field to formula mode, and enter the formula in this format: \nlookup(table name,column name for search: data pill)[column name for result]\nFor an example you can take a look at the gif below. \n\nAlternatively, you can use the Lookup table connector and use either the lookup entry action to get a single entry or the Search entries action to get an array of results. This would allow you to use data from all the columns in your table for mapping in subsequent steps.\n"},"features/callable-recipes.html":{"url":"features/callable-recipes.html","title":"Callable recipes","keywords":"","body":"Callable Recipes\nCallable Recipes are Workato integration recipes that wait for you to call upon them instead of running in the background. A regular recipe begins doing work when the trigger, an external force, occurs. The Callable Recipe only begins work if it is called by another recipe or a Rest API. They make recipe building less complex and help developers create simple apps faster. There are two kinds of Callable Recipes:\n\nCallable Recipes for Recipe Building\nYou can create and save snippets of business logic as a callable recipe, then insert them into a new recipe. These snippets could be the workflow for error handling, approval workflows, or any set of steps in a recipe you use often. It will keep the complexity of your recipes low and only require you to make changes in one place.\nREST Endpoint\nYou can provide a REST API endpoint to an outside party so they can activate the start of a recipe without logging into Workato or use a REST endpoint to bring data from an outside API into an application.\n\nThere are certain steps in a recipe that are often repeated in other recipes, such as the logic for error handling. Now, instead of building out the same 5 steps in each of your recipes, you can save time and make recipe creation easier with a Callable Recipe for Recipe Building. Think of callable recipes like a library of recipe sections that you can grab and insert into a recipe whenever you want to.\nSome common recipe sections that make useful Callable Recipes include expense approval, auto-provisioning accounts in your apps, the notification process when things are not working correctly, and error handling to name a few. Making these recipe sections pre-made and readily available to insert into recipes not only makes recipe building faster, but ensures consistency in your business processes while reducing complexity in your recipes.\nHow to create a callable recipe\nLet’s take a look at an example to see how this works. Say you want to automate the process of creating an invoice in Quickbooks Online (QBO) when an opportunity is closed-won in Salesforce. In order to create a QBO invoice, you’ll need to create a new customer if the customer does not already exist in QBO. Now, this snippet of logic: “creating a customer in QBO when they don’t already exist,” is a process that is necessary not only with your Salesforce to QBO integrations, but also when you have Point Of Sale (POS) transactions flowing into QBO, invoices you receive from your vendors and more. Instead of recreating the logic for “creating a customer in QBO when they don’t already exist,” you can make this snippet of logic into a Callable Recipe.\nStep 1. Create a new recipe\nCreate a recipe as you normally would, and for the trigger, select Callable Recipe under the application picklist. \n\nFill in a Name for the recipe, and fill up the Input Schema and the Response Schema in the JSON Format. You can find out more about JSON in this link (https://support.workato.com/support/solutions/articles/1000234879-schema-definition) here. \n\nIn simple terms, the input schema determines what fields will be shown and need to be filled in when a callable recipe action is created in the calling recipe. The Response schema determines what pills will be available for use in the calling recipes Output data. \nLastly, you may choose to enable REST endpoint for your recipe. This defaults to No\n[\nNext, create your set of actions for the recipe. For this example you would create a set of standard de-duplication stpes, Run a search, and if search gives no results, create a customer, if exisiting customer found, update customer. For a sample recipe, click here https://www.workato.com/recipes/485991\nStep 2: Call recipe\nCreate a recipe that requires the logic from the callable recipe we created earlier. Set up the trigger as required, and when created the actions you need. When you need to call the callable recipe, simply click on Add a new step, select call recipe, choose the recipe you created earlier, and you will see the fields from your input schema appear. Simply drag and drop the required pills and you'll be good to go! \n\nCalling Recipes from Other Apps with REST API\nEnabling a REST endpoint for recipes makes it available to be called by any application, internal or external, as long as they have the API token to do so. The token ensures the security of your API. Choosing to build simple web and mobile apps using Workato and a REST Endpoint takes out a majority of the custom coding that would be involved and ensures a fast turnaround. There are two ways you can use a REST Endpoint:\n\nBring Information Into An App\nYou can connect any app that has an API available with a REST Endpoint even if Workato doesn’t have a connector for that app. For example, if you want to bring in information from Zillow.com so you know how much a real estate property is worth, you can create a REST Endpoint that will populate your fields in QuickBase every time an employee run the recipe.You can also create a button that will start the REST Endpoint recipe. You can place the button wherever you would like, for example inside of Salesforce, so employees can tell the recipe to run without logging into Workato.\n\nSend Information Out Of An App\nAnother scenario where this is useful is monitoring a supply chain – you could have a business partner call upon the REST endpoint you created to track shipping or generate a report via a link on your internal website. You can embed this anywhere you want.\n\n\nTo manage the REST endpoints and the API tokens, go to “Service Catalog” under your username on the right hand corner of the screen. Here, you can easily test your REST endpoints and find the specific URL used to call the REST API. These screenshots will show you a more detailed view of REST API management:\n"},"features/handling-csv-files.html":{"url":"features/handling-csv-files.html","title":"Handling CSV files","keywords":"","body":"Handling CSV files\nWorkato is able to parse CSV files' content as variables to be used in Workato recipes.\nExample CSV file setup\nThe following sample CSV file will be used as the example file.\nManufacturer, Model, Category, Item Name, Item Code, Description, Unit Cost, Unit Price, Taxable, Tax, Custom Field 1, Custom Field 2, Custom Field 3\nSierra Gardening, MS-321, Gardening supplies, Pine wood potting bench, MS-321, Oakwood potting bench, 74.50, 119.99, Yes, 0.0875, Pine, White, 30 inches\nSierra Gardening, MS-322, Gardening supplies, Cherry wood potting bench, MS-322, Oakwood potting bench, 74.50, 119.99, Yes, 0.0875, Cherry, Natural, 30 inches\nSierra Gardening, MS-323, Gardening supplies, Cedar wood potting bench, MS-323, Oakwood potting bench, 74.50, 119.99, Yes, 0.0875, Cedar, Black, 30 inches\nParsing CSV files via connectors' in-built CSV parsing capability\nCertain connectors are able to process CSV files in particular and move individual values from these CSV files into other apps, for example, from the above CSV file:\nSierra Gardening\nMS-323\nCherry\nNatural\nThis is as opposed to simply moving entire files between apps. An example of such a connector is the Box connector. With such connectors, you can simply listen to new CSV files and parse them via the same Workato trigger to move the data into another app.\nParsing CSV files via connectors' in-built CSV parsing capability - example\nIn the following recipe, the Box trigger New CSV file will be used to read the sample CSV file from a Box folder and parse it to Workato as a list of three CSV lines. To try it out, create a CSV file with the above CSV sample and upload into a specific Box folder for the New CSV file trigger to pick up.\nNote - even if you have CSV files with other schema and different header lines in the selected folder and sub-folders, the New CSV file trigger will pick up those CSV files as well and attempt to process them with the header specified. This may lead to job errors or bad data being moved into your app. Ensure that you're only picking up the files you want by keeping all the relevant CSV files in the monitored folder, or by adding a trigger filter to filter only files to pick up.\nThe following recipe parses new CSV files in Box and uses the data parsed to create new NetSuite inventory items.\n\nRecipe that parses CSV files to retrieve data for use in datatree Example recipe\nWhen using Box new CSV file trigger, the expected columns in CSV files has to be declared for Workato to know how the data is structured.

These variables can be used to map into subsequent recipe steps.\n\nUsing the variables created from the columns definition Example recipe\nParsing CSV files via Utility connector's CSV parsing capability\nNot all connectors are able to process CSV files in particular and move individual values from these CSV files into other apps. Such connectors will have triggers that process only files in general. In such cases, we can still try to read the text content of CSV files and parse them explicitly with the Utility connector. This will allow us to move individual values from these CSV files into other apps, for example, from the sample CSV file:\nSierra Gardening\nMS-323\nCherry\nNatural\nParsing CSV files via Utility connector's CSV parsing capability - example\nIn the following recipe, Dropbox files triggered upon are not being parsed in the trigger, hence the additional need to download the content of the file and parse the CSV content for Workato to use. Parsing the CSV lines provides us with a list of lines (with each line having their own set of inventory item values) to utlize, hence we use a Repeat step to iterate through the list of lines and to create an inventory item with each set of values.\n\nExample recipe\nIn the Parse CSV action, provide the file content to the CSV body input field, and specify the header line.\n\nField mapping for the Parse CSV action\nThe header line specified tells Workato how your CSV file's data looks. In this case, we can parse the following line into the proper variables datapill, such that \"Sierra Gardening\" corresponds to \"Manufacturer\", \"MS-322\" corresponds to \"Model\", etc.\nSierra Gardening, MS-322, Gardening supplies, Cherry wood potting bench, MS-322, Oakwood potting bench, 74.50, 119.99, Yes, 0.0875, Cherry, Natural, 30 inches\nThe Parse CSV action's datatree returns a list of CSV lines.\n\nOutput datatree for Parse CSV action showing the variables defined in the header line\nIn order to iterate through this list of CSV lines, we have to use a Repeat step.

Refer to this section.\nMoving text/binary files between apps\nWorkato can move files (regardless of text or binary) from app to app. There are 2 ways of moving files:\n\nVia moving actual file content from one app to the other\nVia providing the destination app with a public URL to the file\n\nMoving text/binary files via public URL\nThis is typically a 2-step process:\n\nGet the public URL of the file to move. Generally found in the datatree output of New file triggers.\n\nPass in this public URL to the destination app. Generally a Upload file via URL action.\n\n\nExample of moving text/binary files via public URL\nLet's take the scenario where we move new files in Dropbox into Box. This is how the recipe looks.\n\nRecipe that moves files from Dropbox to Box via public URLs Example recipe\nThe Obtain a direct URL to file field in the New file trigger should be marked, so as to generate a public URL for the new file. The recipe then verifies that the file does not already exist in Box before uploading the file into Box via URL.\n\nObtain a direct URL for the Box file, then map the URL to the Box file to the upload action Example recipe\nMoving text/binary files via file content\nThis is typically a 2-step process:\n\nDownload the file content of the file to move. Generally found in the datatree output of New file triggers.\n\nPass in this public URL to the destination app. Generally a Upload file via content action.\n\n\nExample of moving text/binary files via file content\nLet's take the scenario where Gmail email attachments need to be moved to Box. This is how the recipe looks.\n\nRecipe that moves Gmail attachments to Box Example recipe\nFrom the New email trigger output, each email event that comes in has potentially a list of attachments. Therefore, the conditional action checks if the email has attachments. If not, nothing is processed for that email. In this case, the datapill from the attachment list in New email trigger is used. As the pills within a list refer to the first list item in that list (e.g. the first attachment within the list of attachments) unless when used in a for each step or in an input array, this allows us to verify if there's at least one attachment in the list.\n\nCheck if email contains at least one attachment Example recipe\nIn cases whereby the email event has one or more attachments, the for each step ensures that the recipe iterates through the list of attachments, and that for each attachment, the attachment content is downloaded from Gmail before being uploaded into Box.\n\nIf email contains attachments, download each attachment from Gmail using attachment ID, and upload attachment content to Box Example recipe\nIn this case, file content is used as Gmail does not provide public URLs to attachments. For scenarios where the source app provides public URLs to files and the target app accepts URLs for file uploads, moving of files via URLs should be the preferred method for recipe efficiency.\nUsing Utilities connector for downloading files from public URL\nThe Utilities connector has a Download file from URL action that retrieves file content, given a public URL to a file. In cases whereby the file source app provides only a public URL to the file, but the destination app requires file content to be provided, this action can be used.\nExample of using Utilities to download file from public URL\nLet's take the scenario where new files created in a shared Box folder needs to be uploaded and associated with a Salesforce account. This is how the recipe looks.\n\nRecipe that uses Utilities to download file content Example recipe\nThe recipe uses the public URL to the Box file to download the file content. This file content is then uploaded into Salesforce as a new attachment, associated to a certain Salesforce account (the account ID is hardcoded in this instance).\n\nDownload file using Box URL, then upload file content to Salesforce Example recipe\nBase64 encoding\nBase64 encoding is a way of converting binary content into a set of standard characters for sending over networks. Certain apps require base64-encoded file content to be uploaded, and usually these same apps will produce base64-encoded file content when their files are downloaded.\nWorkato supports the ability to encode or decode base64 content via formulas.\nTo base64 encode binary content and upload it into such apps:\n\nFormula for encoding file content\nTo decode binary content from base64 content from such apps:\n\nFormula for decoding file content\n"},"user-accounts-and-teams.html":{"url":"user-accounts-and-teams.html","title":"Working with teams","keywords":"","body":""},"user-accounts-and-teams/team-collaboration.html":{"url":"user-accounts-and-teams/team-collaboration.html","title":"Collaboration","keywords":"","body":"Team collaboration\nTeam feature enables multiple users to work on the same Workato account and collaborate on recipes in a shared workspace.

Errors arise when something has gone wrong with the recipe, like when a recipe wasn't configured properly, or the app you are trying to connect with is experiencing downtime.

You will also see a red \nrJD7hmlUodRmH3X4krGRFqY-l3X8P14SLw.png\nThis is a sample of a recipe. The red digit is the number of errors or failed jobs while the green count is the number of successful jobs. You can check out your failed jobs at the \"Jobs\" section after you click into a recipe. Cli \n\nIf you have many jobs in your job history, you can also filter out jobs based on the status of the jobs, so that you can see all the failed jobs at a glance. \n\nUnderstanding failed job messages\nNow that you know how to view failed jobs, its time to learn how to understand failed job messages. When you click onto the failed job, you will be able to take a look at the job page.\n\nThe job page has a few pieces of information that you should be aware of : \nError : Gives you the exact error message from the connector\nError Type : Tells you a general message about what the error is about.\nSource      : Where the error is coming from.\nRed Line | : The red line appears on the left side of an action, andshows the step that is throwing the error. (In the above case, this is on step 3) \nCommon root causes for failure are : \n\nA Required input field was empty. It may not be filled with any value, or the data pill used in that field does not have any value.\nAn object couldn't be found using the key/ID provided in the field.\nYou attempted to create an object with the same/existing names available.\nImproper Formula mode conditions were applied on a null pill \n\nTracing your recipe\nWhen your recipes get too complicated, errors are hard to follow. The best way to trace your errors is a bottom-up approach. Start from where the error is coming from, and work your way from there and follow the data. Here is an example of how you can trace errors\n\nStart with identifying which field in the error step that is rejecting the input. \nOpen up your recipe in a new browser tab. Check what is filled up in that specific field  \nTrace the possible field that is providing the wrong value. Then, check out where the value comes from in that step. \nThe data pill will most probably come from a different step. Now go back to the job page, and check at the output data of that step, and see what is the provided value for that step. \nYou can keep going down the chain to reach the root of the data source. \n\nExample\nErrors are messages that are very important to understand what is wrong. You should devise the meaning of these messages. Some errors are a little more complicated, while some are pretty straightforward. \nKnowing where the source of error is coming from is also very useful to know why is the error being thrown. For example, When we try to make a contact marketable, you may hit an error that is unique to only Infusionsoft : \n \nErrors like this give a whole lot more context into what went wrong, and what can you do to fix them.\nIdentifying the step that error that was being thrown is the most important. The first thing you will need to do is to associate the input data in that step with the error message. \n\nSeems that the company field is empty in my recipe. I need to have a company in my Salesforce's Lead to create one\nI then go back to my recipe, and see what is filled in the Company field in Step 3. Seems like I have a data pill in that field already. I click on the data pill, and it shows that it comes from the Trigger. \n\nNow, I will check what is the actual data that the specific failed job received from the trigger record. I look for the Company value under Profile (where the data pill came from), and found that it does not exist. Seems that the reason that the recipe failed was because it used a data pill that has no value in it. \n\nI want to make sure that there is always value provided in required fields. To do so, I will need to be able to choose a second alternative data pill that I can ensure there is always value in it. \n\nIn this case, I know that there is always a First Name in the Eventbrite's profile. I will turn on formula mode, and put an OR in between the data pills.\n\nNow, if the data pill \"Company\" does not have any value, it will use the value that comes from First Name. I make the change in my recipe, and try re-running the failed job. Seems like it's been completed!\nTo find information on the errors you are facing, simply run a search on our helpdesk with keywords of the error such as the source and details.

Warnings look similar to this:\n\nWhat is the difference between a job error and a trigger warning?\nHow to resolve trigger warnings\nResolving trigger warnings depend on the type of error in the warning. The most common trigger warnings are as follows:\nAPI limit Errors\nSchema Errors\n"},"recipes/formula-errors.html":{"url":"recipes/formula-errors.html","title":"Formula errors","keywords":"","body":"Formula Errors\nWhen formula mode functions are used incorrectly, your Workato recipes will not work in the manner according to your intentions. \nThis section will showcase the most frequent occurances of formula errors and how to troubleshoot them.\nTypes of Formula Errors\nThere are two types of formula errors - Formula Compilation Error and Formula Runtime Error. \nFormula Compilation Error\nFormula compilation error occurs when you have used formula mode within one of your fields in a recipe, but have most likely mispelled the formula function.\nIdentifying the Error\n You will identify that formula compilation error has occured when trying to to test or start the recipe. Workato prevents you from doing so and instead indicates that there is a formula error, and mentions which line in the recipe the error originates from. \nIn the example below, there is no such formula function as .nosuchformula, and the recipe is prevented from being started. \n\nTroubleshooting the Error\nTo troubleshoot and resolve the error, simply open the indicated lines, check and correct the formula functions used in the fields which are in formula mode. \nIn some cases, you might have accidentally turned on the formula mode field without intention, also resulting in the formula compilation error.\nFormula Runtime Error\nFormula runtime error is slightly trickier to troubleshoot. In these cases, the formula functions in the field are spelt correctly, but have most likely been used in an incorrect manner. We will look look at two examples below. \nIdentifying the Error (Example 1: Formula received a nil value)\nFormula runtime errors are not as straightforward to identify as compilation errors. Instead, they are discovered to be present when a recipe error is encountered and when looking through the job report. \n\nTaking a look at the GIF above, the identified error is:\n Error calculating input for field 'title': Formula received a nil value: undefined method '+' for nil:NilClass\nYOu can see that the error description suggests the Formula function has failed because it receives an unexpected value. In other words, it implies that in one of the step's field, there lies a wrong use of a formula function that has caused the recipe to fail.\nTroubleshooting the Error\nWhen heading the recipe step, the recipe field shows two data pills concatenated between two strings. By taking a look at the data pills, it suggests that both data pills are empty for this particular record, and caused the formula mode to fail.\n\nTo fix this case, we need to ensure that the formula field always return a value, or makes sure that the data pill that I used will always return a certain value. \nIn short, the most important thing would be to figure out if the formula function is used correctly.\nIdentifying the Error (Example 2: No Method Error)\nAgain, looking through the job report will allow you to take a look at the recipe error. The no method error is another obvious keyword that highlights a formula error. \n\nTaking a look at the GIF above, the identified error is:\n NoMethodError: undefined method `include?' for 2:Fixnum\nTroubleshooting the Error\nTo be able to solve this error, we need to learn more about the .include? formula function. There actually exists such a method in the Workato platform. .include? is useful to determine if a certain data pill contains a certain text. \n\nHowever, when using the function on certain data pills or value that is numerical or non-text, it will not be able to accept the input and process it.

An example of how this can be done is as follows:\n\nFrom the image above, we can see that the action is updating the 'Opportunity' object in Salesforce with the QuickBooks Invoice ID and URL. This update is made to the field: Contact Description. \nThus, in the trigger, filter out the jobs that already have an entry in this field. This prevents the job from running again as every job that has been succesfully synced by Workato will populate the field with data. \nThe update will be picked up by Workato but not processed as it is filtered out by the trigger filter.\nBest Practices\nCreating Custom Fields\nCreate fields in the connected applications that are meant for identifying jobs synced by Workato. Referring to the above example in 'Trigger Filters', the Contact Description field in the Salesforce Opportunity should always be empty so that Workato will identify that as a job to be synced over.\nThus, it is not advisable to use a commonly used field for these purposes, as they may be filled in by mistake and cause that job to be filtered out in the trigger. \nUse specific labels like: \"Synced by Workato\" or \"QuickBooks Invoice URL\" to prevent mistakes like these from happening.\n"},"recipes/deduplication.html":{"url":"recipes/deduplication.html","title":"Deduplication","keywords":"","body":"Deduplication\nWhy should I ensure steps are taken for deduplication in my recipes?\nDeduplication ensures only 1 unique instance is stored in each of your applications. Ensuring that the steps below are taken in every recipe will prevent unwanted duplicates of the same record which can make data in your business applications very messy.\nStep-by-Step Guide\nView this recipe to see an example of how deduplication can be done with Workato in a few simple steps: https://www.workato.com/recipes/486082\n1. Trigger\nIn this recipe, the trigger event is a New or Updated Contact in Salesforce. This means that whenever a Contact is created or updated in Salesforce, the recipe runs.\n\n2. Search\nThe search action searches the QuickBooks for the Display name which corresponds to the Contact's full name in Salesforce. \n\nUnique Identifiers in Applications\nTo ensure that there is only 1 unique instance in each application when performing searches, use a unique identifer. In QuickBooks, the Display Name is one of them (ie. Display Names are unique in QuickBooks and no 2 customers can have the same display name). \nIn other applications, commonly used identifiers are IDs and Record Numbers. These numbers can often be found appended to the end of the URL of the object.\n3. Conditional Actions\nTo ensure the search action is looking for a perfect match, the conditional action that follows uses the 'is present' and 'is not present' conditions. \n\nTip: If you wish to do a partial search, use the 'Contains' condition.\nThe Data field you want to test is also a unique identifier in QuickBooks. In this case, Customer ID is used. For every Customer in QuickBooks, there is a unique ID. Thus, if the 'Search' action finds a customer in QuickBooks with a corresponding name, the Customer ID is sure to exist.\nIf a customer is found, the Customer ID will be present. In this case, we want to update this record in QuickBooks. This can be used to update information such as the Customer's phone number, email, billing/shipping addresses etc.\nIn step 4, if a Customer is not found, we want to create a new customer record using existing information from Salesforce.\n\n"},"recipes/rate-limiting.html":{"url":"recipes/rate-limiting.html","title":"Rate limiting","keywords":"","body":"Rate limiting\nMost APIs have a cap on the number of API calls you can make within a certain period.

It should be used as a username with a blank password in the standard basic authentication format.\nSo, to adjust the connections portion of the code to suit this behaviour, simply request for an API instead of username + password.\nIn the credentials section, pass the api_key into user() and an empty string (\"\") to password()\nconnection: {\n\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: \"api_token\",\n      control_type: \"password\",\n      label: \"API token\",\n      optional: false,\n      hint: \"Available in 'My Profile' page\"\n    }\n  ],\n\n  authorization: {\n    type: \"basic_auth\",\n\n    # Toggl API expect the token to be sent as user name and the string 'api_token' as the password\n    # curl -u \"{your api_token}:api_token\" \"https://www.toggl.com/api/v8/me\"\n    credentials: lambda do |connection|\n      user(connection[\"api_token\"])\n      password(\"api_token\")\n    end\n  }\n}\n\nAnother variation is to have a generated api_token replace the user name and have the string \"api_token\" replacing password in the basic authentication format.\nAPI Key Authentication\nFor APIs that expect API Key authentication, it is a slight variation from the basic authentication code above.\nMake sure to include the required inputs from the user (subdomain, api_key, scope etc)\nDefine\n\ntype: \"api_key\"\nthe appropriate parameter name for the API Key.

Returning the access token with a key of accessToken in a JSON response will result in an unsuccessful Workato request to your token_url.\nUsually this will not be a problem because most OAuth libraries out there will do most of the heavily-lifting for you, such as returning response in the right format etc. It is good to be aware of this!\n\n\n\n"},"developing-connectors/sdk/authentication/custom-authentication.html":{"url":"developing-connectors/sdk/authentication/custom-authentication.html","title":"Custom auth","keywords":"","body":"Custom Authentication\nOccasionally, the API requires an authentication mechanism different from the typical ones.

A match with the signals defined here will raise an error.\nWhen there is a match here, two things can happen.\nFirstly, there can also be a match against refresh_on signals. When that happens, a re-authorization is triggered (acquire block is executed) instead of raising an error. In this case, detect_on is used to match errors hidden behind responses with status code 200, then used to identify that a credentials refresh is required.\nIf a match here does not match any of the signals defined in refresh_on, an error will be raised.\ndetect_on: [\n  \"sample error message\",\n  /^\\{\"response\":\\{\"error\".+$/\n]\n\nThe example here shows multiple ways that we can define \"signals\" to watch\n\n\"sample error message\": The exact string matching the whole body of response\n/^\\{\"response\":\\{\"error\".+$/: Regex matching the body of response\n\nThis list is optional.

A poll trigger constantly executes a poll block for new events at fixed time intervals. This time interval depends on a user's subscription (5 or 10 minutes). At the same time, it is also able to support pagination. This is useful to prevent request timeouts when making requests with large response results. A trigger can execute immediate consecutive polls to retrieve events from successive pages.\nThere are two types of trigger. The classic trigger type is used by default if type is not specified. The other type is called the \"paging_desc\" trigger, which can be used only for endpoints that provide events sorted in descending order. This trigger type has an auto-paging mechanism that lets you build a simple and efficient trigger. (described in detail below)\nA ruby hash is returned in each poll. This hash should contain a few keys. The array of events, or data, should be passed into the events key. At the same time, a cursor is saved in next_page/next_poll (depending on the trigger type). This cursor provides information about where the current poll stopped, and used in the next poll. A classic type trigger has an additional key can_poll_more, which can be defined to conditionally fire immediate polls for multi-page results.\nClassic Trigger\nNo need to define any type to use the classic trigger. This type is usually used for APIs that only return responses sorted in ascending order.\nupdated_ticket: {\n  input_fields: lambda do\n    [\n      {\n        name: 'since',\n        type: :timestamp,\n        optional: false\n      }\n    ]\n  end,\n\n  poll: lambda do |connection, input, last_updated_since|\n    page_size = 100\n    updated_since = (last_updated_since || input['since']).to_time.utc.iso8601\n\n    tickets = get(\"https://#{connection['helpdesk']}.freshdesk.com/api/v2/tickets.json\").\n              params(order_by: 'updated_at',\n                     order_type: 'asc',\n                     per_page: page_size,\n                     updated_since: updated_since)\n\n    next_updated_since = tickets.last['updated_at'] unless tickets.blank?\n\n    {\n      events: tickets,\n      next_poll: next_updated_since,\n      can_poll_more: tickets.length >= page_size\n    }\n  end,\n\n  dedup: lambda do |ticket|\n    ticket['id']\n  end,\n\n  output_fields: lambda do |object_definitions|\n    object_definitions['ticket']\n  end\n}\n\npoll\nArguments\nA poll block is given 3 arguments.\nThe first argument is connection, used to access inputs from connection field values. This is frequently used to access domain or subdomain information from the user.\ninput provides access to trigger input field values from the recipe. Inputs like \"created_since\" a particular date is usually used in a trigger to allow filtering historic records. In this case, Knack does not provide filtering by record created dates, input is given an empty array.\nThe last argument, usually given the name last_updated_since or last_created_since, is the cursor \"stored\" from a previous poll. This is crucial to a good trigger design. It is used to determine where the last poll stopped and where to begin next. As an example, it is usually given the last (latest) \"updated\"/\"created\" time. When the trigger is first started, this value is nil.\nOutput\npoll: lambda do |connection, input, last_updated_since|\n  page_size = 100\n  updated_since = (last_updated_since || input['since']).to_time.utc.iso8601\n\n  tickets = get(\"https://#{connection['helpdesk']}.freshdesk.com/api/v2/tickets.json\").\n            params(order_by: 'updated_at',\n                   order_type: 'asc',\n                   per_page: page_size,\n                   updated_since: updated_since)\n\n  next_updated_since = tickets.last['updated_at'] unless tickets.blank?\n\n  {\n    events: tickets,\n    next_poll: next_updated_since,\n    can_poll_more: tickets.length >= page_size\n  }\nend\n\nIn a classic type trigger, the expected output contains events, next_poll and can_poll_more.\nevents expects an array of individual results to be processed through the recipe as individual events.\nnext_poll is a cursor that will be passed on to the successive poll (third argument of poll block.\nImportant:\nThis trigger type does not have automatic-immediate polling. Immediate polling is determined by can_poll_more, which is a boolean value for whether an immediate poll should be made.\nExample JSON response:\n[\n  {\n    \"id\": 1,\n    \"updated_at\": \"2016-08-13T00:53:44Z\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": 2,\n    \"updated_at\": \"2016-09-14T02:25:00Z\"\n  },\n  ...\n]\n\nWhen a get request receives this JSON response, it looks up the array for the last record (latest record) and passes it as the cursor for the next poll. It also checks the response array size. If it is equal to the size limit, it is likely that there are more records matching this request in consequtive pages. Hence the expression given to can_poll_more evaluates to true and invokes an immediate successive poll. This loop continues until response array size is smaller than page limit.\nAt the end of the loop. The last (latest) created date is passed as next_poll. This value will be used in the next poll cycle to pick up new records.\ndedup\nDedup block is used to identify individual events. It is given a single argument \"event\", which corresponds to individual elements in the records array passed into \"events\".\nA typical dedup input is event[‘id’] where the event argument name can be replaced to make the code more readable. This should be used only in classic triggers.\ndedup: lambda do |ticket|\n  ticket[\"id\"]\nend\n\nIn some instances, a record needs to be proccessed as separate events. A typical scenario is updated records. To do this, append updated timestamp field to the dedup expression like so.\ndedup: lambda do |ticket|\n  ticket[\"id\"] + \"@\" + ticket[\"`updated_at\"]\nend\n\nWith this, 2 occurence of a record with the same \"ID\" but with different \"updated_at\" values will be recorded as separate events.\nDescending Trigger\nnew_alert: {\n  type: :paging_desc,\n\n  input_fields: lambda do\n    [\n      {\n        name: 'since',\n        type: :timestamp,\n        optional: false\n      }\n    ]\n  end,\n\n  poll: lambda do |connection, input, page|\n    limit = 100\n    page ||= 0\n    created_since = (input['since'] || Time.now).to_i\n    offset = (limit * page)\n\n    response = get(\"https://api.pingdom.com/api/2.0/actions\").\n                 params(from: created_since,\n                        limit: limit,\n                        offset: offset)\n\n    {\n      events: response,\n      next_page: (response.length >= limit) ? page + 1 : nil\n    }\n  end,\n\n  document_id: lambda do |response|\n    response['checkid']\n  end,\n\n  sort_by: lambda do |response|\n    response['time']\n  end,\n\n  output_fields: lambda do |object_definitions|\n    object_definitions['alert']\n  end\n}\n\ntype\ntype: :paging_desc - This type should be used only if results are in descending order. A paging_desc trigger works by assuming a descending order and continuously poll for all unique records. If the API is unable to return records in descending order, ignore this key to use the classic trigger.\nA record of all event IDs (defined in document_id ) is recorded for each recipe. Each recipe will \"remember\" all event IDs that is processed through a trigger. \nBased on assumption of order, the trigger can stop the polling cycle once a similar event IDs is observed. This is because further polls will return events \"before\" and would have already been processed by the trigger. At this point, the trigger stops polling and wait for the new poll cycle for new events. The Workato trigger framework handles deduplication in the background.\npoll\nPoll block is where you define how events are obtained. Typically, a GET request is used to retrieve a list of records to be processed as trigger events.\nArguments\nDescending trigger polls have the exact same argument structure. connection, input and cursor. The one difference is that the last argument is usually given the name page. In a descending trigger, this argument is usually used to pass the page number instead of record timestamp.\nOutput\nSimilar to a classic trigger, the events in output here expects an array of results.\npoll: lambda do |connection, input, page|\n  limit = 100\n  page ||= 0\n  created_since = (input['since'] || Time.now).to_i\n  offset = (limit * page)\n\n  response = get(\"https://api.pingdom.com/api/2.0/actions\").\n               params(from: created_since,\n                      limit: limit,\n                      offset: offset)\n\n  {\n    events: response,\n    next_page: (response.length >= limit) ? page + 1 : nil\n  }\nend\n\nInstead of next_poll, paging_desc type trigger should be given next_page as cursor. It is used for passing the next page to be polled.\nA typical response looks like this.\n{\n  \"current\": \"https://api.sample.com/records?order=desc&from=2016-12-09T22%3A57%3A13Z&page=1\",\n  \"next\": \"https://api.sample.com/records?order=desc&from=2016-12-09T22%3A57%3A13Z&page=2\",\n  \"data: [\n    {\n      \"checkid\": 123,\n      \"time\": \"2016-12-13T19:09:01Z\",\n      ...\n    },\n    {\n      \"checkid\": 124,\n      \"time\": \"2016-12-10T06:20:00Z\",\n      ...\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nresponse[\"data\"] is an array of results from the request, which should be passed to events. While it varies between APIs, most will provide some form of pointer to the next page of results. In this example,response[\"next\"] is an API generated url to be used to retrieve the next page of results matching the request. Hence we can simply pass it to next_page. In the successive poll, this value is passed to the poll block and the next set of records is retrieved.\nOn the last page, response[\"next\"] is usually null. In that case, it will cause the successive poll to make the same request as in the first page. When this happens, the trigger framework detects a duplicate event (mechanism for detection explained in detail later) and halts all immediate polls. At this point, the trigger goes to \"sleep\" until the next poll cycle.\nNew records being added in the cloud instance will appear in the first page of requests since records are returned in descending order. The trigger picks up new records and processes them until a duplicate event is detected, at which point it \"sleeps\". This trigger type depends on a descending order to retrieve only \"new\" records and stops upon detection of \"old\" records.\nThis way, the trigger polls for new records efficiently, without making any repeated requests to retrieve the entire set of records in each poll cycle.\ndocument_id\nSimilar to dedup, paging_desc type triggers uses document_id to identify unique records. Write an expression that can uniquely identify the \"ID\" of records.\ndocument_id: lambda do |event|\n  event[\"checkid\"]\nend\n\nUnlike classic triggers, there is no need to include timestamp fields into the document_id expression to deduplicate updated records. Descending triggers have an additional block sort_by to process this.\nsort_by\nIn addition to document_id, this block is used to define the field that is used to sort records (in descending order). It could be \"created_at\" or \"updated_at\" or similar fields.\nsort_by: lambda do |event|\n  eent[\"time\"]\nend\n\n"},"developing-connectors/sdk/trigger/webhook-trigger.html":{"url":"developing-connectors/sdk/trigger/webhook-trigger.html","title":"Webhook trigger","keywords":"","body":"Webhook Trigger\ntriggers: {\n  new_message: {\n    type: :paging_desc,\n\n    input_fields: lambda do |object_definitions|\n      object_definitions[\"room\"].only(\"id\")\n    end,\n\n    webhook_subscribe: lambda do |webhook_url, connection, input, recipe_id|\n      post(\"https://api.ciscospark.com/v1/webhooks\",\n           name: \"Workato recipe #{recipe_id}\",\n           targetUrl: webhook_url,\n           resource: \"messages\",\n           event: \"created\",\n           filter: \"roomId=#{input['id']}\")\n    end,\n\n    webhook_notification: lambda do |input, payload|\n      payload[\"data\"]\n    end,\n\n    webhook_unsubscribe: lambda do |webhook|\n      delete(\"https://api.ciscospark.com/v1/webhooks/#{webhook['id']}\")\n    end,\n\n    dedup: lambda do |message) {\n      message[\"id\"]\n    end,\n\n    output_fields: lambda do |object_definitions|\n      object_definitions[\"message\"]\n    end\n  }\n}\n\nwebhook_subscribe\nThis block is called when the recipe is being started to run necessery API calls to subscribe for further webhook notifications.

Let's break it down. Firstly, we define a POST to request to the appropriate endpoint:\npost(\"https://api.intacct.com/ia/xml/xmlgw.phtml\")\n\nNext, we add a payload to the request in the form of a hash first:\n.payload(\"control\": [\n         {\n           \"senderid\": [{ \"content!\": connection[\"sender_id\"] }],\n           \"password\": [{ \"content!\": connection[\"sender_password\"] }],\n           \"controlid\": [{ \"content!\": \"testControlId\" }],\n           \"uniqueid\": [{ \"content!\": false }],\n           \"dtdversion\": [{ \"content!\": 3.0 }]\n         }\n       ],\n       \"operation\": [\n         {\n           \"authentication\": [\n             {\n               \"login\": [\n                 {\n                   \"userid\": [{ \"content!\": connection[\"login_username\"] }],\n                   \"companyid\": [{ \"content!\": connection[\"company_id\"] }],\n                   \"password\": [{ \"content!\": connection[\"login_password\"] }]\n                 }\n               ]\n             }\n           ]\n           \"content\": [\n             {\n               \"function\": [\n                 {\n                   \"@controlid\": \"testControlId\",\n                   \"get_list\": [\n                     {\n                     \"@object\": \"glaccount\",\n                     \"@maxitems\": \"1\"\n                     }\n                   ]\n                 }\n               ]\n             }\n           ]\n         }\n       ])\n\nElements are represented by arrays of hashes, since XML elements can repeat without any extra notation. Element data is defined using the content! key and attributes using @ prefix (example: @object and @maxitems).\nNext, we add the necessary headers with the headers shorthand method:\n.headers(\"Content-type\": \"x-intacct-xml-request\")\n\nFinally, we use the format_xml method (since we require both request and response in XML) and pass it the root element name as an
