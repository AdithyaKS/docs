is Workato?\nWorkato helps you automate business workflows across cloud apps, on-premise apps and employees. e.g. automate quote to cash business process which may involve Salesforce, Netsuite, Bill.com, Apttus, etc. Workato combines an enterprise-grade workflow automation platform with the ease of use expected from consumer apps, enabling biz users and IT to quickly build workflow automations.\nThe integration problem\nThe average enterprise uses over 1000 different apps. These frequently include both cloud-based and on-premise applications. In addition, personal and business productivity applications such as chat, social media, calendering, and the like are a key part of daily work and data from these is often unintegrated with other business data.\nWithout automated integration, organizations cannot leverage the full power of data in their multiple applications, re-enter data multiple times across applications, constantly context-switch across applications to accomplish tasks, and so on.\nThe challenges of integration\nAutomated integration solves the problem of data silos and manual workflows. But if you are going to automate transactions that span applications, then these processes must be reliable, secure, and manageable. Business and IT users need visibility into the running integrations and the capability to take appropriate action if an error or exception occurs.\nA viable integration solution must be able to handle the complexities of real-world problems. Real-world integration problems often require more than just transporting single data objects across applications. They may require multi-step processes with business logic, workflow capabilities, one-to-many or many-to-one data mappings, and other such challenges. Many applications are also customized to the preferences of a particular business, and integrations must be able to handle these customizations since they are a part of the organization’s business processes.\nSome of the issues we see with integration solutions today:\n\nPowerful integration products are oriented toward technical users, while citizen integrator products sacrifice capability for usability\n\nCitizen integrator products need to be enterprise-grade in terms of reliability, scalability and security\n\nAdding new, complex integrations can involve long implementation times spanning months, while new apps are coming online much faster than that\n\nIntegration platform products are relatively high cost, sometimes costing more than the applications being connected\n\nIT needs visibility into the integration processes. Where necessary, it should be possible for IT and business users to collaborate to create and manage integration solutions.\n\n\nWorkato addresses these issues with an enterprise-class integration tool that can be governed and monitored by IT, but with the ease of use and low barrier to entry expected from consumer applications.\nEnterprise-grade foundation\nThe Workato platform has a powerful feature set to handle real-world problems, including the integration of applications, data and people. Both cloud-based and on-premise systems are supported. The runtime system is designed for security, robustness, reliability and high performance.\nCitizen integrators\nWorkato is the only integration platform that was built from the ground up to support a single design interface for developer/IT and citizen integrators, ensuring that citizens and IT have access to the same ease-of-use driven productivity improvements, and at at same time offering citizens the same power and capability available to IT.\nConversational integration\nWorkato provides a chat based (Slack, Microsoft Teams, Cisco Spark, IBM Workspace, etc.) bot building platform for building compelling UX centered around integrations and workflows.\nIT Governance\nGovernance is a key requirement for any platform that allows business users to work with corporate data. Workato Aegis is a management tool that provides cross-enterprise visibility into users/usage, integration processes and the applications they connect. Workato Aegis supports assigning differing levels of responsibility and visibility within the platform, and enables collaboration between business and IT users. It enables implementation and enforcement of policies to improve security and governance across all Workato users within an enterprise.\nExtensible platform\nWorkato’s platform is extensible to add support for new applications beyond the many that are available pre-built. A powerful and configurable REST data connector allows integration with many systems without writing any code. Workato also provides a Connector SDK that handles and abstracts multiple aspects of application and data integration for cases where custom development is required. Existing connectors can be extended via the SDK or via adding functions from the REST connector. In addition, a public API allows control of recipes from third-party applications.\n"},"workato-concepts.html":{"url":"workato-concepts.html","title":"Concepts","keywords":"","body":"Concepts\nHere are the core concepts and terminology that you'd need to know in order to use Workato.\nRecipes\nRecipes are automated workflows built by users that can span multiple apps, e.g. moving new accounts from Salesforce into Zendesk as new organizations. Each recipe comprises of a trigger and one or more actions that are carried out when a trigger event is picked up.\nWhen recipes are started, they will run automatically in the background to look for trigger events and carry out recipe actions. When they are stopped, they will cease to look for trigger events.\nHowever, when a recipe is started again, it will pick up all the trigger events that occurred since the recipe was stopped. In other words, stop functions like pause.\nYou can set recipe visibility to be public or private. When they are set to be public, any Workato member can see this recipe, and make a copy for their own use.\nAll recipes have a unique ID that identifies them.\n\nRecipe IDs can be viewed from the URL on the recipe page\nThe recipe above has a trigger and just one action. The trigger is New Salesforce account - this trigger will fire whenever a new account is created in Salesforce. The action Create Zendesk organization will create an organization in Zendesk each time the trigger event occurs (i.e. when a new account is created in Salesforce).\nTriggers\nTriggers determine what event to listen to in order to execute the actions described in a recipe.\nTrigger events can be set off in apps (e.g. Salesforce, JIRA) when a certain event happens (e.g. new contact is created, existing ticket is updated), when a new line is added in a file, or according to a schedule (fires at a certain time or interval), etc.\nDepending on the available API, Workato can receive trigger events in real-time, or check for the occurrence of an event periodically by polling the app.\nYou can learn more about triggers and how to use them .\nSteps and actions\nRecipe steps are executed every time the trigger event occurs. Recipes are required to have at least one step. The most basic step for a recipe is an action e.g. an action to create an organization in Zendesk.\nWorkato steps can be actions, conditional actions, list actions, actions that call other recipes, try/catch, etc.\nYou can read more about recipe steps here and actions here.\nDatatree and datapills\nEvery step, including triggers, brings data into the recipe. e.g. a new employee in Workday trigger would bring in employee data. This data is made available in the recipe via the datatree.\nThe individual data fields are called datapills. You can use the datapills in subsequent steps. You can read more about datapills here.\nThe following is the output datatree for the trigger New Salesforce account. This datatree contains all the variables known to us and available for use whenever a trigger event occurs.\n\nOutput datatree for New Salesforce account trigger\nFor example, as seen in the screenshot, whenever a new Salesforce account is created, we're able to get the following values for this particular new Salesforce account:\nAccount description,\nAccount fax,\nAccount ID,\nAccount name,\nAccount number,\nAccount phone,\nAccount rating,\nAccount site,\nAccount source,\netc.\nThese values can be used in subsequent steps of the recipe by being passed into input fields, as covered next.\nInput fields and fields mapping\nTriggers and actions have input fields. Input fields are how triggers and actions are designed to carry out customized workflows, and they can take in variables (datapills) or constants.\nWhen we insert variables (datapills) or constants into input fields, that's called fields mapping. You can read more about fields mapping here.\nThe following is an expanded view of the Create Zendesk organization action. In this view, we can see two input fields: Name and Notes.\n\nInput fields for the action Create Zendesk organization\nMapping variables\nThe variable Account name has been mapped to the Name input field. This means that for every new Salesforce account that is created, the account name of this Salesforce account will be used as the organization name of the Zendesk organization that will be created. For example, a new Salesforce account named Sattei Winery will in turn create a Zendesk organization named Sattei Winery.\n\nInput field with variable mapping\nMapping constants\nOn the other hand, the input field Notes has a constant mapped to it - the words \"Synced over from Salesforce.\" This means that all newly created Zendesk organizations created via Workato will always have the words \"Synced over from Salesforce.\" in its Notes field.\n\nInput field with constant mapping\nHere's an example of the new Zendesk organization created via the above mapping:\n\nNewly created Zendesk organization Sattei Winery\nConnections\nFor a recipe to communicate with apps via actions and triggers, it has to be authorized to interact with apps. This authorization is referred to as a connection. Connections are not tied to a recipe - a single connection can be used by multiple recipes. You can read more about app connections here.\n\nSalesforce and Zendesk connections from the recipe view\nJobs\nEach time there is a trigger event, the actions in the recipe are executed. The entire flow of each trigger event through the recipe is called a job. Jobs can be successful (when actions are executed successfully), or have errors (when an action results in an error). When an error is encountered, subsequent actions are not executed. You can read more about jobs here.\nJobs report\nThe job report gives a high-level summary of the all the trigger events processed by the recipe. The entire flow of each trigger event through the recipe is called a job.\nInformation such as date, time processed and job IDs, can be found here. From this jobs history page, users can view more detailed information about a job by clicking on it.\nYou can read more about job reports here.\n\nJobs report page\nJob details\nThe job details page provides step-by-step input/output details of a single trigger event as it is processed by the recipe. This page is useful for troubleshooting recipes as users are able to view the data passed into each step and the resultant output returned after each step was executed. You can read more about job details here.\n\nJob details page showing the syncing of Salesforce account Myers Brewery to Zendesk\n"},"connections.html":{"url":"connections.html","title":"Connecting apps","keywords":"","body":"App connections\nFor every app your recipe interacts with, Workato needs to be authorized to communicate with the apps on your behalf. Workato typically uses the app's API, and it may require OAuth based authorization, API keys, etc.\nThis authorization is referred to as an app connection.\nIn many cases recipes will require a valid app connection before triggers and actions can be configured, to retrieve custom objects and fields, picklist values and other information ('meta-data') that helps with recipe construction.\n\nRecipe prompts user to connect to their Salesforce organization. You will notice that the picklist is greyed out. This is because the recipe needs a valid connection to Salesforce to get the list of available Salesforce objects.\nA connection is created when a user authenticates with the app via Workato, and gives Workato permission to access the data. Each connection should correspond to one app instance, hence multiple recipes can and should utilize the same connection if working with the same app instance.\nAuthentication\nAuthentication (or authorization) usually occurs in the following standard ways, although there are some apps with custom authentication flows.\n\nOAuth2\nOAuth1 (and variations)\nBasic authentication\nAPI key or secret\n\nIn each of the highlighted authentication flows, an app user has to authorize Workato with the permission to access app data. The exact permissions Workato will get to read from and write to the app usually corresponds with the permissions of the connected app user.\nFor more information on connecting to a specific app, refer to the specific app connector documentation.\nExample: Authentication flow for Salesforce\nThe following recipe requires both Salesforce and a Zendesk connections, which are both OAuth2. The Connection tab within the recipe shows further details about the app connections.\n\nRecipe syncing new/updated Salesforce accounts to Zendesk as organizations. Example recipe\nThe following shows the Connections tab. Zendesk has been connected, but the Salesforce connector has no connection established yet.\n\nRecipe without a Salesforce connection established\nClicking on the Connect button generates a popup that requests for Salesforce login credentials. Because Salesforce utilizes the standard OAuth2 authentication flow, usernames and passwords are provided only to Salesforce. Providing these credentials assure Salesforce that the user is giving permission for Workato to access their Salesforce data.\n\nOAuth2 authentication popup for Salesforce\nAfter providing credentials, Salesforce will show up as connected. Now the recipe can use this connection for construction and running.\n\nRecipe with Salesforce and Zendesk connections established\nIntegration user\nWorkato recipes typically automate workflows for a company or a department on behalf of many users. i.e. the integrations will work no matter who created an invoice or a ticket. This requires that the connection used has broader permission that spans multiple users. As a result, the connected user is typically a special integration user created just for integration purposes.\nFor example:\n\nA recipe that moves new accounts in Salesforce to Zendesk as new organizations will need read access to Salesforce accounts and write access for Zendesk organizations.\nA recipe that moves new cases in Salesforce to JIRA as new issues will need read access to Salesforce cases and write access for JIRA issues.\n\nApps have different granularity when it comes to defining user roles and permissions. Refer to the specific connector documentation  for more information on required permissions to connect to the app.\nUsing connections\nTypically a company may only have a single instance of an app and they may have another instance a sandbox for testing, etc. So a user would need just one connection for multiple recipes that work with the same app instance.\nIn cases whereby there are more than one app instance to connect to, e.g. when working with sandboxes and production organizations or teams, multiple connections should be created, with each connection authenticated with each separate instance.\nMost Workato connectors allow only one connection to an app within a recipe.There are some connectors which allows you to work with two app instances within the same recipe.\nHere is an example where the same recipe works with two Saleforce instances i.e. primary and secondary connectors.\n\nRecipe with primary and secondary Salesforce connectors. Example recipe\nThe recipe requires two separate Salesforce connections.\n\nPrimary and secondary Salesforce connections\nRefer to the secondary connectors article to find out more.\n"},"recipes/building-recipes.html":{"url":"recipes/building-recipes.html","title":"Building recipes","keywords":"","body":"Building recipes\nThis section covers the basic components of a recipe: triggers, steps and actions. These components allow you to define the logic of a recipe - what to carry out under different conditions.\nThe following recipe portrays one trigger and five steps, with different actions being carried out in steps 1, 3 and 5.\n\nRecipe that creates or updates Zendesk organizations depending on whether this Zendesk organization exists. Example recipe\nThis section also covers fields mapping, which delves into the details of how we map pills to define how data is moved from one app to another.\n"},"recipes/triggers.html":{"url":"recipes/triggers.html","title":"Triggers","keywords":"","body":"Triggers\nSome basic trigger rules\n\nEach trigger event will be processed only once. i.e. no duplicates\nTrigger events will be processed in the same order as when the events were created (in the app)\n\nTrigger types\nTriggers can be classified into different types based on how they check for and retrieve new events\nPolling,\nBatch,\nReal-time,\nScheduled,\nScheduler/Clock\nPolling triggers\nPolling triggers check for new events by periodically querying the app to see if new events are available. The polling frequency is determined by the type of Workato plan, and can be as low as 5 minutes.\nEach poll may yield multiple events ready for processing i.e. a single poll can result in several jobs being created.\nWhen the recipe is first started, the polling trigger fetches all events after the From date. Subsequently, polls are made at regular intervals as dictated by the plan type.\nWhen the recipe is stopped, polling triggers stop fetching events from the trigger app. However, if the recipe is started again, polling triggers will fetch all events since the recipe was stopped.\nExample: Polling trigger\nA Workato account on the Business plan has a 5-minute polling interval, as displayed on their polling triggers.\n\nTrigger hint regarding the specific polling interval\nThe recipe polls every 5 minutes for new accounts created in Salesforce, and fetches any new accounts. If there were multiple accounts created, each will result in a new job.\nIf the recipe is stopped on 1 Feb 2017, midnight PST, it will cease to fetch trigger events. However, when the recipe is started again, lets say on the 10 of March midnight PST, Workato will fetch all Salesforce accounts created since Feb 1.\nBatch triggers\nBatch triggers are similar to polling triggers in terms of how they fetch new events. But, where polling triggers will create a new job for every trigger event, batch triggers will create a new job for a group of events. This group size i.e. batch size can be specified by the end user as part of the trigger configuration. Typical values for batch size are 100.\nBatch triggers are generally used for increasing throughput.\nFor further details about batch triggers, refer to the Batch processing article here.\nReal-time triggers\nReal-time triggers are usually built on top of an asynchronous notification mechanism. Real-time triggers typically require registration in your connected app (either via the API or manually via the app interface), to let the app know that you are interested in a specific event. When that event occurs, the app will send a notification to Workato and generate a trigger event.\nWebhooks are one such mechanism. Most real-time triggers supported on Workato are built on webhooks. The advantage of webhooks is that there is no delay, and it is more efficient as we only receive notifications from apps when events occur, instead of Workato having to check at regular intervals for new events.\nReal-time triggers supported by Workato (this excludes HTTP real-time triggers) are generally webhooks supported by regular polling. The polling intervals for real-time triggers are generally longer than the normal polling triggers, however, i.e. instead of polling once every 5 minutes or so, the trigger can now poll once every hour. The polling mechanism in real-time triggers is also what allows you to select a From date at the time of recipe start.\nScheduled triggers\nScheduled triggers are executed at specified days and times, hourly, daily, monthly, etc.\n\nVarious schedule options for Salesforce scheduled search trigger\nAt the scheduled time or interval, this trigger will fetch all events matching the specified criteria. Also, unlike other triggers, scheduled triggers will return events that have already been picked up previously.\nScheduled triggers will return events in batches, similar to how batch triggers work. Users can specify the maximum batch size, e.g. if the batch size is set to 100 and 420 new events are identified, 5 new jobs will be created. The first four jobs will have 100 events each and the fifth will have 20 jobs.\nScheduler/clock/timer\nScheduler triggers allows you to schedule when exactly your recipe will run. There are two triggers:\n\nNew scheduled event\n\nThis trigger allows you to specify the time the recipe should first trigger, and subsequently, the time intervals to continue triggering on.\n\nBasic scheduler trigger that triggers the first time when recipe is started, then subsequently every hour after that\n\nNew scheduled event (advanced)\n\nThis trigger allows you to specify the days of the week the recipe should trigger on, as well as the times it should trigger on. If you specify only the minutes, e.g. 30, the recipe will trigger 24 times in a day, every 30 minutes past the hour. If both hour and minute inpur fields are filled, the recipe will trigger once a day.\n Advanced scheduler trigger that triggers every Monday at midnight 0000\nSince/From\nThe Since or From setting enables recipes to fetch past trigger events from a specified date and time. i.e. instead of picking up new trigger events (events created since recipe was started) this enables picking events that have already occurred.\nIn the example below, the New Salesforce object trigger has a From date as 1 Jan 2017, midnight PST and the 'accounts' object is selected.\n\nSetting the Since date for the trigger. Trigger will only pick up new accounts created since midnight of Jan 1, 2017\nWhen the recipe is started, only Salesforce accounts created after 1 Jan 2017, midnight PST will be picked up, as viewed from the created date column on the job report.\n\nJob report shows that only Salesforce accounts created after Jan 1, 2017 were processed\nIf the trigger was New/updated Salesforce object, only Salesforce accounts created or updated after 1 Jan 2017, midnight PST will be picked up.\nHowever, not all triggers have the Since/From parameter. For such triggers, the date and time from which trigger events will be fetched is predetermined by default, usually as an offset from the time the recipe is started. Common values are:\n\nWhen recipe is first started\nAn hour before recipe is first started\nA day before recipe is first started.\nThis offset is usually communicated in the trigger hint for the connector.\n\nThe Since/From value can only be set once, and will be locked from further changing after the recipe has been started for the first time.\n\nTrigger hint regarding the default offset of 1 hour ago for Google Calendar\nTrigger conditions\nTrigger conditions are additional rules that define what kind of trigger events should be selected for processing, e.g. You can specify that only Salesforce accounts from California must be procssed.\nTrigger conditions are evaluated by Workato i.e. Workato retrieves all trigger events, and then filters out the ones that do not meet the rules specified in the trigger condition.\nTo add a trigger condition, check the Trigger IF checkbox. The trigger datatree will appear, displaying the variables that can be used to formulate the trigger condition.\n\nChecking the Trigger IF checkbox brings up trigger condition fields to be configured\nDefine the trigger condition. For more information on the available conditions you can use, refer to the IF condition article. The following ensures that only Salesforce accounts with a Warm rating value will be picked up by the trigger. Values are case sensitive and should be exact.\n\nDefine the trigger condition\nTo add an additional trigger condition, select from the OR or AND in the picklist. The selected operator will define how all additional trigger conditions will be added.\n\nAdding another trigger condition with the OR operator\nDefine the additional trigger condition. Values are case sensitive and should be exact. The following ensures that accounts with a Hot rating value will also be picked up by the trigger. Notice that from the third trigger condition onwards, trigger conditions will be combined with the previously selected operator (OR or AND).\n\nDefine the additional trigger condition. Subsequent trigger conditions has to use the same AND operator\n"},"recipes/steps.html":{"url":"recipes/steps.html","title":"Steps","keywords":"","body":"Steps\nRecipe steps can be actions, or control flow statements that help you describe business logic.\n\nVarious recipe steps available in recipe editor\nAction step\nActions carry out an operation in your target app, usually a create, update, or search operation. Each action requires a set of input fields and typically returns data i.e. output data tree.\nExample: Action step\nThe following step carries out a Search organizations action in a Zendesk integration. The input fields on the left shows the available fields to search for a Zendesk organization by:\n\nName\nTags\nNotes\nDetails\n\nIn the following case, the Search organization action is carried out by name.\n\nSearching Zendesk organizations by Salesforce account name. Example recipe\nWhen the Search organizations action has been carried out, Zendesk returns data about the organizations found, if any. The output datatree displays available fields for mapping in subsequent steps.\nIn the following case, the Update organization action uses the ID field from the Search organizations action to identify which Zendesk organization to update (ID field as highlighted).\n\nUpdating Zendesk organization identified by ID. Example recipe\nConditional action step\nConditional actions will only be carried out if the specified condition is true. All actions indented within a conditional action block will be carried out only if that condition is true. For more information on the available conditions you can use, refer to the IF condition article.\nExample: Conditional action step\nThe following recipe has two conditional steps:\n\nIf Zendesk organization was found, update Zendesk organization\nIf Zendesk organization was not found, create new Zendesk organization\n\n\nRecipe that uses conditional steps to decide whether to create or update Zendesk organization. Example recipe\nIn this example, any job can only proceed through either one of the conditional steps, as the Zendesk organization must have either been found or not.\nRepeat step\nWhen working with a list of items (e.g. a list of invoice line items), you may need to carry out a set of actions for every item in the list. The repeat step helps you do that. Actions indented within a repeat block will be carried out for all items in the list.\nThe input to the repeat step is a list. Actions within a repeat block should use data output from the Repeat step's datatree. This ensures that every item in the list is processed.\nExample: Repeat step\nRefer to the example scenario of syncing Salesforce accounts (using the batch trigger) to Zendesk as organizations.\n\nRecipe that uses the Repeat step to iterate through list of Salesforce accounts. Example recipe\nIn this example, the trigger returns a list of Salesforce accounts. Since Zendesk does not support batch actions, each Salesforce account must be added one at a time from Salesforce to Zendesk.\nThe list datapill has to be passed into the repeat step. When the input list field is selected, only list type datapills are usable in the datatree, as shown below. List type pills can be identified via their stack icon.\n\nMapping a list data pill into the Repeat step's input list field. Example recipe\nDatapills from the Foreach output datatree should be mapped to ensure that values from each list item are used when the action is repeated. For example, if two Salesforce accounts are fetched by the trigger, using pills from the Foreach datatree ensures that the Create organization action creates a Zendesk organization with the data from the first Salesforce account on its first iteration, then with the data from the second Salesforce account on its second iteration.\n\nUsing datapills from the Repeat step's datatree. This ensures values from the list being iterated through are used. Example recipe\nThe following displays the mapping from the Foreach datatree.\n\nDatapills are mapped from the Repeat step's datatree. Example recipe\nFor further Repeat step examples or more info about list processing, refer to the list management article.\nCall recipe step\nCall recipe will run another recipe (named a callable recipe). Callable recipes are like functional calls in programming languages. They offer an easy way to reuse recipe logic.\nYou should note that callable recipes are executed synchronously. i.e. the calling recipe will be blocked waiting for the called recipe to finish processing.\nCallable recipes are an advanced feature in Workato that you can read more about in the callable recipes article.\nStop step\nThe stop step ends a single job from being processed any further. It is usually used in cases when there is a an error in the business logic and further processing of the job is not required.\nThe stop step can be configured to mark the job as a failed or a successful, depending on business logic.\nExample: Stop step\nThe following recipe expects all Salesforce accounts to be present in Zendesk as organizations. In cases where no corresponding Zendesk organization is found, the recipe will stop processing further actions.\n\nRecipe that utilizes the Stop step to send email and end job. Example recipe\nAny job ran by this recipe can proceed through either one of the conditional step, as the Zendesk organization must have either been found or not. If not found, the job will stop at Step 4. If found, the job will not carry out actions within the conditional step (Steps 3 and 4), instead only updating the matching Zendesk organization.\nThis recipe marks the job as an error, so that the recipe owner will take notice of this job and attempt to rerun it.\n\nConfiguring the Step step's error message. Example recipe\nAction with error handler step\nThis step allows you to monitor for errors in actions, similar to the try/catch concept in programming lanaguages.. When an error occurs, you have the chance to:\n1) retry the sequence of actions again, in case it was a temporary error such as network issues, or\n2) take remedial actions, such as notifying users of the error via email or error messages in the app, or to carry out a rollback (i.e. reversing the job by deleting any created or half-created records).\nThis step consists of 2 blocks: the Monitor block and the Error block. Actions to be monitored for errors should be within the Monitor block. If all actions are successful, the Error block will be ignored. However, if any action in the Monitor block results in an error, the actions within the Error block will be executed.\nAuto-retry\nWhen using the error monitor step, you can setup the actions within the Monitor block to be auto-retried by Workato in cases of action failures. By default, the Monitor block actions will not be reran.\n\nError block defaults to the do-not-retry selection\nYou have the option of retrying up to 3 times, and of selecting the time interval to wait between each retry.\n\nRetry configuration fields\nYou can also define a condition that has to be met before the Monitor block can be auto-retried. For more information on the available conditions you can use, refer to the IF condition article.\n\nConfiguring the retry condition field. In this example, the actions in the Monitor block will only be carried out again if the error message does not contain the 401 error code.\nExample: Error monitor step\nThe following recipe tries to update the Zendesk organization right after the search step, regardless of whether any Zendesk organizations were found. In cases where no matching Zendesk organization is found, the Update organization action will fail.\n\nRecipe that uses the error monitor to monitor failures in updating Zendesk organizations. Example recipe\nAs the recipe catches failed actions within the error monitor block, failed Update organization actions will be caught, and the recipe proceeds to carry out steps within the Error block immediately, as no auto-retry was configured. In this case, it seems that the only reason for the update failing is because no matching Zendesk organization was found. Hence the remedial step creates a new Zendesk organization.\nExample: Error monitor with retry step\nIf the actions in your Monitor block tends for fail for temporary reasons such as network issues or timeout issues, it would make sense to use auto-retry, such that the recipe will attempt to execute the steps again until it succeeds, for a maximum of 3 tries.\nWe will reuse the same same error monitor exmaple recipe from above, where we try to update the Zendesk organization right after the search step, regardless of whether any Zendesk organizations were found. In cases where no matching Zendesk organization is found, the Update organization action will fail.\n\nRecipe that uses the auto-retry to recover from action failures in updating Zendesk organizations. Example recipe\nIf updating the Zendesk organization fails, the recipe will check to see if the error message contains a 401 error code (i.e. unauthorized error). If the error is an unauthorized error message, we know that further attempts will still fail as this means we don't have the right permissions to update the Zendesk organization, perhaps because of changed permissions. If the error is not an unauthorized error message, we will proceed to retry the update organization action again after the specified period of time, e.g. 5 seconds, up to a maximum of 3 tries.\n"},"recipes/actions.html":{"url":"recipes/actions.html","title":"Actions","keywords":"","body":"Actions\nEvery connector makes available a set of actions. Apart from connectors, Workato makes several utility actions available (e.g. create pie chart, get file from URL, etc.).\nActions can be grouped into the following types\nCreate,\nUpdate,\nUpsert (create or update),\nSearch,\nGet,\nDelete,\netc.\nWe will use the Zendesk and Salesforce connectors to illustrate these actions. Check out the Workato recipe here and install it into your Workato account if you would like to test out these actions.\nCreate\nThe Create object action allows you to create any standard or custom object. In Salesforce, creating an account requires at least an Account Name to be stated.\nCreate action will typically return an ID that can be used to look up the newly created object. Sometimes, the entire object (with all the fields) will be returned. This depends on the API Workato uses to connect to the apps.\n\nCreate action\nUpdate\nThe Update Object action allows you to make changes to existing objects. The input to this action will usually be data that will uniquely identify the object to be updated.\nIn this example, it will the Salesforce Account ID.\nUpdate action will return the ID or the entire object (with all the fields) of the updated object.\n\nUpdate action\nSearch\nThis action is used to search for an object given a set of data that help identify an object.\nSearch will return all objects matching the specified criteria. i.e. Search returns a list of objects.\nIf no objects are found, search will return an empty list. i.e. Search will not throw an error. This will cause downstream actions that depend on the results of the search to fail.\n\nSearch action\nGet\nGet is similar to search, but is more pinpointed - it requires a unique ID identifying the object to be passed. If object is available, it will return the details of the object.\nIf the the object is not found, get will thrown an error.\nIn the case of Salesforce, using the Get action on an Account will require you to input the Salesforce Account ID.\n\nGet action\nUpsert\nUpsert is a combination of search, and create or update. Upsert will first search to see if an object exists, if object exists, it will update it otherwise it will create a new object.\nThe Salesforce upsert action will perform a search for the object based on the object ID, create the object if it does not exist, else perform an update on it with the input field values.\n\nUpsert action\nDelete\nDelete actions allows you to delete any object. The input to this action is usually an ID that identifies the object to be deleted. However, most apps do not support delete, so Workato does not have broad support for deletes.\nAs the nature of this action can lead to permanently lost data, it is best to be cautious and understand the implications when using this action in Workato recipes.\n\nDelete action\n"},"features/if-conditions.html":{"url":"features/if-conditions.html","title":"IF conditions","keywords":"","body":"IF conditions\nIF conditions can be found in multiple features in Workato:\n\nTrigger conditions\n\nYou can set IF conditions for your triggers to define what subset of trigger events should be processed by the recipe, e.g. only new Salesforce accounts with the type \"Customer\", or only Salesforce leads with the rating \"Hot\".\n\nThe Salesforce trigger has the trigger condition set to only process new/updated cases with the status of \"Closed”\n\nConditional action step\n\nYou can set IF conditions within your recipes to better define the workflow procesing logic, e.g. update the Zendesk organization if found, otherwise create new Zendesk organization.\n\nRecipe that uses conditional steps to decide whether to create or update Zendesk organization.

In this example, the actions in the Monitor block will only be carried out again if the error message does not contain the 401 error code. Example recipe\nConditions\nEach condition consists of 3 parts - data, condition and value. Conventionally, the data (left-hand-side) is the variable data from your app, e.g. case status, or lead rating. Accordingly, the value (right-hand-side) is the static value you wish to check against, e.g. \"Closed\" or \"Hot\", correspondingly. Data and values are case sensitive.\nIn this article, we go through the 14 conditions you can choose from. We will be using trigger conditions as examples. Additionally, you can combine multiple conditions with the AND or OR operators to set up complex conditions.\nEach condition will be valid for different data types. If a condition is attempted to be used for invalid data types, it might prevent the recipe from starting successfully.\nFurthermore, if an invalid IF condition was set up for triggers, the recipe might:\n\nthrow a trigger error after the recipe has started, resulting in the inability to pick up trigger events, or\nresult in the recipe filtering out all trigger events.\n\n\ncontains\nThis condition checks if the data contains the value.

They are variables that you can use in mapping business logic into recipe steps. e.g. to create an Zendesk organization from a Salesforce account you will assign data pills from Salesforce account to the Zendesk organization action input fields.\nData pills are contained within datatrees, within the App Data section. At an recipe step, the App Data section contains the output from the trigger and every action preceeding this step.\n\nDatatree within a recipe step\nWhen you're configuring a recipe step, all data from the preceeding steps will be available for use in the fields mapping of that step.\n\nMultiple datatrees available when configuring a recipe step\nData types\nData pills can be of the following data types\n\nString\nInteger or number\nDate or datetime\nBoolean\nArray/hash (list)\n\nWhen mapping (i.e. assigning data pill to an input field) it is important that they are 'type' compatible. Workato will do default type conversions where it can be done with no ambioguity or loss of information.\nType conversions\nCertain data types can be converted from one to the other using formulas. For example, if you wish to convert a text string of numbers into integer type so as to perform arithmetic on it, or if an app expresses a datetime as a string, but you wish to convert it into a proper datetime type.\nThe list of available type conversion formulas are as follows:\n\nto_currency\nto_date\nto_f\nto_i\nto_s\nto_time\n\nAdditional type conversions may be added from time to time - you can check out the formula editor to see if there is the formula you're looking for.\nPreview data\nWorkato will display sample data (fetched from your account) alongside data pills to help better understand the data in your app.\nIn example below, you can see sample data in italics next to the data pills.\n\nOutput datatree for New Salesforce account trigger\nFields mapping\nFields mapping is defined as the assignment of data pills (variables) or absolute values (constants) into action or trigger input fields. This controls the flow of data between apps.\nBy mapping fields from a Salesforce account (from a trigger) to a Zendesk create organization action, you can ensure that the Zendesk organization and Salesforce account have the same data.\nIn every recipe step, you have access to data pills from all the previous steps' and can be used in configuring input fields of current step. In this way, we're crafting a template that determines data flow in your recipe.\nExample\nIn the following example, we map the Account Name data pill from the Salesforce New account trigger into the Message input field in the Send email action.\n\nMapping the account name data pill into the message input field\nMapping constants vs mapping variables\nWorkato input fields can be assigned variables (data pills) or constants (absolute values).\nMapping variables\nThe variable Account name has been mapped to the Name input field. This means that for every new Salesforce account that is created, the account name of this Salesforce account will be used as the organization name of the Zendesk organization that will be created. For example, a new Salesforce account named Sattei Winery will in turn create a Zendesk organization named Sattei Winery.\n\nInput field with variable mapping\nMapping constants\nOn the other hand, the input field Notes has a constant mapped to it - the words \"Synced over from Salesforce.\" This means that all newly created Zendesk organizations created via Workato will have the words \"Synced over from Salesforce.\" in its Notes field.\n\nInput field with constant mapping\nHere's an example of the new Zendesk organization created via the above mapping:\n\nNewly created Zendesk organization Sattei Winery\nMapping both constants and variables\nYou can also combine constants and variables in the input fields for the data you wish to have.\nExample\nLet's take the scenario where we wish to send out a simple welcome email to every new Salesforce lead who has signed up. The recipe looks like\n\nRecipe that sends a welcome email to new Salesforce leads. Example recipe\nIn the Send email action, pills from the New Salesforce lead datatree have been mapped into the input fields.\n\nExample of data pills being mapped into an action step\nSince pills are variables, their value will depend on a specific trigger event, or action. In this example, the value assigned to the To input field, will depend on the value of email in each new lead. If a new lead called Madison Diaz with the email address madisondiaz82@gmail.com is created, the recipe will pick it up and promptly send an email to the address madisondiaz82@gmail.com with the message:\nHi Madison,\n\nThanks for joining our mailing list! We're excited to have you!\nData transformation\nData fields from one app may not directly map into a data field for a different apps. For example:\n\nyour sales app stores names in a single field full name, but your marketing app uses two fields first name and last name\nyour ecommerce app stores addresses as individual fields, e.g. address line 1, address line 2, city, state, but your accounting app simply requires a single billing address field\nthe priority levels in your ticketing app may be low, medium, high, but in your sales system they're low, normal, urgent\n\nIn such cases, you can take advantage of Workato's data transformation capabilities by using formulas.\nCommon issues when mapping fields\nHere are some of the common errors we've experienced when it comes to fields mapping\n\nData pills with no values at run-time for required fields\nAt design-time (when we're building the recipe), all required fields are supposed to be mapped. The recipe will refuse to start and throw an error if a required field is left empty.\nHowever, even if an input field has been mapped at design-time, it might not actually have a value at run-time (when a trigger event comes in and a job is being processed). In such a case, that specific job will throw an error and fail.\nYou would need to decide how to handle such cases whereby a required field might not receive a value at run-time. If that is rightly a business logic error which needs to be resolved, e.g. the recipe tries to move a new lead from a sales app to a marketing app, but finds that it's missing an email address for the lead, the answer might be to let the job fail and flag the employee who had created the lead record.\n\nData pills from the wrong datatree\nWhen mapping input fields with data pills, it is common to find pills with the same names in the datatrees, e.g. if you're moving customers from an app to another, customer datatrees tend to hold address information. Hence you might find yourself using a pill with the right name, e.g. City, State, Country, but from the wrong datatree.\n\nData pills from the wrong part of the recipe\nIf your recipe has conditional steps, e.g. if customer is present, update customer record, and if customer is not present, create customer record, then for each job that's processed, there will be steps that are not carried out. In such cases, the values in the datatree for these steps will most likely be blank.\nIf you're using data pills from these steps, you need to recognize the potential of these pills being null, and handle that scenario.\n\n\n"},"recipes/version-management.html":{"url":"recipes/version-management.html","title":"Version management","keywords":"","body":"Version management\nEvery time a recipe is saved, a version of the recipe is saved.

You don't want to turn on an inaccurate automation that moves lots of data wrongly - that probably results in a lot of cleanup work to do!\nThe test recipe button picks up a single trigger event and runs it through your recipe. This allows you to check for recipe correctness. Typically, the test button show up by default for a new recipe, while the start button can be found in the dropdown list.

In short, your recipe picks up the same trigger events as it would have if you clicked on recipe start. The only difference is that the recipe controls the number of trigger events processed - in this case, one.\nThe Since/From date cannot be changed once you have selected it.

This ensures that you're using realistic data but not working with production, possibly mission-critical data.\nAdd Stop steps to prevent unwanted actions from happening\nAdd a Stop step to the recipe when testing to prevent the recipe from carrying out steps that you're not interested in testing. For example, if you simply wish to test your conditional actions and verify that data is being carried out with the correct steps, you can add stop steps to prevent the recipe from actually carrying out any actions within the conditional step.\n\nRecipe with additional stop steps in steps 3 and 6 to test conditional actions\nTest all possible scenarios\nRecipes often come with multiple lines of conditional logic. In the following example, the recipe will either create a Zendesk organization, or update an existing Zendesk organization.\n\nRecipe with conditional steps that syncs Salesfore accounts and Zendesk organizations\nTo test this recipe, we suggest testing with a couple of trigger events that will test out both paths, e.g. with a Salesforce account that has a corresponding Zendesk organization, and with a Salesforce account that doesn't.\nTest all mapped data fields and pills\nTo ensure data is being transformed (if applicable) and moved from one app to the other correctly, test all data being moved. For example, in the following recipe, we're moving Account Name, Account Description and Account Phone from Salesforce into Zendesk. During testing, best practice is to ensure that these three data fields in Salesforce has data, and then verify that these input fields in Zendesk (Name, Details and Phone) has the right data moved from Salesforce.\n\nMapped input fields\nStart recipe\nStarting a recipe will cause it to pick up trigger events and process them through the recipe. When a recipe is started, it becomes active.\nStarting a recipe for the first time\nWhen a recipe is first started, it will fetch trigger events from the Since/From datetime defined. Subsequently, it will continuously process these events. If you had defined the Since/From date during testing previously, this date cannot be changed again for this recipe - you can find out more here.\nIf you had tested your recipe in test mode before starting, the recipe will not reprocess any trigger events previously picked up during testing. This prevents duplication of data in your apps.

For example, if it was stopped on Monday, and started again from Thursday, the recipe will fetch all trigger events since Monday and process them.\nHowever, this might not be the case for recipes with real-time triggers powered by webhooks - trigger events that occur during the time that the recipe was stopped might not be picked up by the recipe. You can read more about real-time triggers and webhooks here.\nStop recipe\nStopping a recipe makes it inactive. It will stop picking up trigger events. Recipes have to be stopped to make changes to the recipe, or to rename the recipe.\nMost Workato recipes will continue where they have left off when a recipe is restarted from a stopped state. This depends on the trigger it has. For most Workato triggers, the recipe will continue to process jobs from when it stopped - for example, if it was stopped on Monday, and started again from Thursday, the recipe will fetch all trigger events since Monday and process them.\nHowever, this might not be the case for recipes with real-time triggers powered by webhooks - trigger events that occur during the time that the recipe was stopped might not be picked up by the recipe.

If false, the nested actions do not take place, and the recipe proceeds to the next possible action.\nIn the following example, we see that the conditional action in step 2 evaluated to false. In this case, steps 3-4 were not carried out as there were nested steps within the conditional action. The recipe therefore skipped to carry out step 5.\n\nJob details for recipe with conditional action\nRepeat step\nRepeat steps will not display steps made during all iterations. For example, if your foreach step processed a list with 10 items, only the last (tenth) item will show up in the job details page.\nSimilarly, when an error occurs within a repeat step, the job details will show only the steps carried out in that particular iteration, and not any other iteration before that.\n\nError within repeat step\nRerun jobs\nAny job (completed, failed, etc.) can be rerun. Workato stores the data of the trigger event, and reruns jobs using this copy of the trigger event.\nRerun of a job will always use the latest version of the recipe. i.e. if the recipe has been modified since the job ran, rerun will use the most recent version.\nYou can find out more about job reruns here.\nTimeouts\nIf a job or a single step is taking too long to execute, it will time out. The current limit is 25 seconds for a single step, and 90 seconds for a single job. The error message for a job that times out will explicitly mention the reason.\nIn these cases, you might have to further optimize your recipe to ensure that they don't hit this time limit.\n"},"recipes/rerun-job.html":{"url":"recipes/rerun-job.html","title":"Rerun job","keywords":"","body":"Rerunning jobs\nWorkato allows for jobs to be rerun. In such cases, the trigger event will run through the sequence of actions in the recipe again. This feature is useful when:\n\nYou've edited the recipe and want to test it\n\nAn error occured in a job, you've fixed the recipe/data and wish to rerun the job\n\n\nNote: When jobs are reran, the trigger event is ran through the entire recipe. Duplication may occur, so be sure to check and remove duplicates (if present) before re-running the job. Also, see our guide on how to create a robust recipe to prevent duplication here.\nTo rerun jobs from the jobs report page, check the jobs to rerun and click on the rerun button.\n\nRerunning jobs from jobs report page\nYou can also rerun jobs when within the job details page. Simply click on the rerun button.\n\nJob rerun from job details page\nJob reruns are in-place - meaning that the position of the job will not change within the jobs report. A job which was first processed in August and reran in September will retain its position amongst the other jobs processed in August.\nCached trigger data in job reruns\nAll job reruns use cached data. This means that the original trigger event's data is reused for the rerun, and any changes made to the trigger event in the trigger app will not be picked up by a job rerun. This means that there are scenarios whereby a job rerun will not resolve your issues:\n\nwhen the failed job is due to data issues in the trigger\n\nwhen you update the trigger event and wish to see how the recipe processes the new trigger event\n\n\nIn such cases, if you are using a New object trigger, you might need to delete the existing trigger event (data from your app) and recreate a new trigger event, e.g. if you have a New Salesforce account trigger, you would have to delete that newly created Salesforce account and recreate a new Salesforce account for the recipe to pick up the Salesforce account with the correct data.\nHowever, if you have a New/updated object trigger, you wouldn't have to delete the record with the wrong data, but simply update the record and let the recipe pick up the update, e.g. if you have a New/updated Salesforce account* trigger, you can update the newly created/updated Salesforce account to fix the wrong data, and the recipe will pick up that account again with the correct data.\nFor both cases above, a new job will be picked up.\nJob rerun history\nWithin the job details page, you can view the rerun history of the job.\n\nJobs history\nIn the job details screen, if you're viewing a job rerun which is not the latest version of the job reran, the Rerun button will be greyed out.\n\nRerun button is greyed out if you're not in the latest ran job details screen\nCommon scenarios for rerunning jobs\n\nTesting a new recipe\n\nWhen testing your recipe after building or after editing, it's a good idea to test all scenarios. If your recipe has conditional actions, it is best practice to test out all logical branches in the recipe.\nFor example, in the following recipe, a trigger event carries out either steps 2-3, or steps 4-5. In this case, we should test out the recipe flow for a Salesforce account which has no matching Zendesk organization, as well as a Salesforce account which has a matching Zendesk organization.\n\nRecipe with two logical branches. Example recipe \nBecause the trigger is New/updated Salesforce account, we can simply create a new Salesforce account and let the recipe pick it up and process it through steps 4-5 to create a corresponding Zendesk account. After that, we can make a quick edit to the Salesforce acccount for the recipe to pick up the updated record, in which case it will run this Salesforce account through steps 2-3 as it will now have a matching Zendesk organization.\nHad the trigger been New Salesforce account, we would have to stage our tests differently. We would need to create a Salesforce account with a matching Zendesk organization, as well as a Salesforce account with no matching Zendesk organization, and check that both jobs are carried out correctly.\nFor any times, during testing, people incrementally build and test a recipe with the same job. During the testing phase, rerunning jobs is commonly used to fix the errors encountered in recipes.\nRather than creating new trigger events, rerunning the same job will allow you to fix the errors 1 step at a time with the same event.\n\nErrors\n\nWhen an error occurs in your recipe, the job will be incomplete as it will have ended where the error occurred (unless you're using the Error monitor step to recover from errors). In such cases, rerunning the job is necessary to ensure the job runs to completion as specified in the recipe, unless the issue is with the trigger data, in which case you should refer to this section about handling trigger errors.\nData retention policy\nData retention applies to processed trigger events. This means that older jobs might not be able to be reran.

There are 2 main types of errors a job may encounter - this article explains both errors and how they can be resolved.\nTrigger errors\nTrigger errors occur when the recipe tries to retrieve trigger events by polling the trigger app. The recipe might fail to retrieve trigger events in the following cases:\n\nWhen the connection becomes invalid and the recipe is unable to connect successfully to the app. Usually results in an unauthorized error message.\nWhen the connected user does not have the right permissions to retrieve the trigger events. Usually results in an unauthorized error message.\nWhen the recipe makes an API call that is somehow broken, e.g. due to schema changes in the app that wasn't reflected in the recipe via a schema refresh.\nWhen the recipe makes an API call that times out while waiting for the trigger events. This is usually transient, i.e. the API server might be experiencing temporary downtime.\nWhen the trigger filters put in place are logically incorrect, e.g. when a null value is checked against an integer, etc. In such cases, the trigger filters will need to be fixed before the recipe can run properly.\n\nTrigger warnings\nWhen a trigger error is met, the recipe will surface a trigger warning, but continue to poll for trigger events. No failed jobs will be reflected on the jobs report, because no jobs were created - the recipe was unable to even retrieve any trigger events to be processed.\nIn the following case, a trigger warning was raised because the schema recorded in the recipe did not match the schema in the app. The warning suggests refreshing the schema as a way to resolve the trigger error, and further details of the error can be seen when expanded.\n\nTrigger warning surfaced on the recipe due to outdated schema that needs refreshing\nRecipes stopped by Workato\nWhen the recipe has encountered 60 trigger errors, it will be stopped by Workato automatically under the assumption that there's a critical, non-transient error with the trigger configuration or connection that needs to be fixed.\n\nRecipe stopped due to 60 trigger errors\nAn email notification will be sent to the Workato account owner when a recipe is stopped due to 60 trigger errors.\nAction errors\nAction errors occur when the recipe tries to carry out an action, e.g. trying to create a new lead record, or trying to search for a specific account in Salesforce, and fails to do so. Actions might fail in the following cases:\n\nAn invalid input was provided to the app, e.g. a number was expected for an invoice subtotal amount but a string (text) was passed in instead, or the values \"High\", \"Medium\" and \"Low\" were expected values, but the value \"Normal\" was passed in instead\nAn input was required, but when the job was carried out, a null value was passed into the field\n\nIn cases of action errors, the Input tab shows the data passed into the action, while the Output tab usually shows the error message. You can usually figure out what's wrong by checking the data in the input tab.\n\nJob error as shown in job details page\nRecipes stopped by Workato\nWhen the recipe encounters 5 successive action errors that are identified by Workato as an unauthorized error, rate limit error or schema error, the recipe will be stopped by Workato automatically under the assumption that there's a critical, non-transient error with the action configuration or connection that needs to be fixed.\nError notifications\nWorkato sends email notifications to the Workato account owner by default when errors occur.\nNotification policy\nThere are certain rules that determine when an email is sent:\n\nEmail is sent when a recipe encounters a certain type of error for the first time, e.g. unauthorized, timeout.

Workato prevents you from doing so and instead indicates that there is a formula error, and mentions which line in the recipe the error originates from. \nIn the example below, there is no such formula function as .nosuchformula, and the recipe is prevented from being started. \n\nTroubleshooting the Error\nTo troubleshoot and resolve the error, simply open the indicated lines, check and correct the formula functions used in the fields which are in formula mode. \nIn some cases, you might have accidentally turned on the formula mode field without intention, also resulting in the formula compilation error.\nFormula Runtime Error\nFormula runtime error is slightly trickier to troubleshoot. In these cases, the formula functions in the field are spelt correctly, but have most likely been used in an incorrect manner. We will look look at two examples below. \nIdentifying the Error (Example 1: Formula received a nil value)\nFormula runtime errors are not as straightforward to identify as compilation errors. Instead, they are discovered to be present when a recipe error is encountered and when looking through the job report. \n\nTaking a look at the GIF above, the identified error is:\n Error calculating input for field 'title': Formula received a nil value: undefined method '+' for nil:NilClass\nYOu can see that the error description suggests the Formula function has failed because it receives an unexpected value. In other words, it implies that in one of the step's field, there lies a wrong use of a formula function that has caused the recipe to fail.\nTroubleshooting the Error\nWhen heading the recipe step, the recipe field shows two data pills concatenated between two strings. By taking a look at the data pills, it suggests that both data pills are empty for this particular record, and caused the formula mode to fail.\n\nTo fix this case, we need to ensure that the formula field always return a value, or makes sure that the data pill that I used will always return a certain value. \nIn short, the most important thing would be to figure out if the formula function is used correctly.\nIdentifying the Error (Example 2: No Method Error)\nAgain, looking through the job report will allow you to take a look at the recipe error. The no method error is another obvious keyword that highlights a formula error. \n\nTaking a look at the GIF above, the identified error is:\n NoMethodError: undefined method `include?' for 2:Fixnum\nTroubleshooting the Error\nTo be able to solve this error, we need to learn more about the .include? formula function. There actually exists such a method in the Workato platform. .include? is useful to determine if a certain data pill contains a certain text. \n\nHowever, when using the function on certain data pills or value that is numerical or non-text, it will not be able to accept the input and process it. The error is a result of such misuse, where literal numbers or non-text data pills are called on with .include?. (See Image above)\nTo resolve this, first check if the value in the data pill is returned as a number. If yes, you may first use .to_s to turn the number into literal text before applying .include?\n"},"recipes/infinite-loops.html":{"url":"recipes/infinite-loops.html","title":"Infinite loops","keywords":"","body":"Infinite Loops\nWhat are infinite loops and when do they occur?\nInfinite loops are logic errors that cause a recipe to run continuously because an action in the recipe is also triggering the recipe again.\nInfinite loops occur most commonly when the recipe is performing a bi-directional sync (ie. when there is more than 1 application and data moves from Application A to Application B and back to A) \nThe example below shows how an infinite loop may occur: \n\nThe trigger picks up any New or Updated Contact in Salesforce. \n\nIn the final step, the recipe is configured to update the same object with information from QuickBooks.\n\nBecause of this update step, the recipe is triggered again since the trigger uses two date/time fields (i.e. Created Date and Last Modified ) in the object records to determine if the record was newly created or updated.\nInfinite loops may also occur if you have multiple recipes running at once and a similar issue occurs where one recipe is updating another that is triggered by an update in an object.\nSigns the recipe is in an infinite loop\nRecipes may be in an infinite loop if:\n\nThere is an unexpectedly high transaction count \n\nThe recipe is triggered when there are no new trigger events in the applications\n\nThere are many duplicates of an object in applications that was created by a recipe\n\n\nHow to prevent infinite loops\nTrigger Filters\nIn order to stop the re-triggering of recipes, implement filters in the trigger. An example of how this can be done is as follows:\n\nFrom the image above, we can see that the action is updating the 'Opportunity' object in Salesforce with the QuickBooks Invoice ID and URL. This update is made to the field: Contact Description. \nThus, in the trigger, filter out the jobs that already have an entry in this field. This prevents the job from running again as every job that has been succesfully synced by Workato will populate the field with data. \nThe update will be picked up by Workato but not processed as it is filtered out by the trigger filter.\nBest Practices\nCreating Custom Fields\nCreate fields in the connected applications that are meant for identifying jobs synced by Workato. Referring to the above example in 'Trigger Filters', the Contact Description field in the Salesforce Opportunity should always be empty so that Workato will identify that as a job to be synced over.\nThus, it is not advisable to use a commonly used field for these purposes, as they may be filled in by mistake and cause that job to be filtered out in the trigger. \nUse specific labels like: \"Synced by Workato\" or \"QuickBooks Invoice URL\" to prevent mistakes like these from happening.\n"},"recipes/deduplication.html":{"url":"recipes/deduplication.html","title":"Deduplication","keywords":"","body":"Deduplication\nWhy should I ensure steps are taken for deduplication in my recipes?\nDeduplication ensures only 1 unique instance is stored in each of your applications. Ensuring that the steps below are taken in every recipe will prevent unwanted duplicates of the same record which can make data in your business applications very messy.\nStep-by-Step Guide\nView this recipe to see an example of how deduplication can be done with Workato in a few simple steps: https://www.workato.com/recipes/486082\n1. Trigger\nIn this recipe, the trigger event is a New or Updated Contact in Salesforce. This means that whenever a Contact is created or updated in Salesforce, the recipe runs.\n\n2. Search\nThe search action searches the QuickBooks for the Display name which corresponds to the Contact's full name in Salesforce. \n\nUnique Identifiers in Applications\nTo ensure that there is only 1 unique instance in each application when performing searches, use a unique identifer. In QuickBooks, the Display Name is one of them (ie. Display Names are unique in QuickBooks and no 2 customers can have the same display name). \nIn other applications, commonly used identifiers are IDs and Record Numbers. These numbers can often be found appended to the end of the URL of the object.\n3. Conditional Actions\nTo ensure the search action is looking for a perfect match, the conditional action that follows uses the 'is present' and 'is not present' conditions. \n\nTip: If you wish to do a partial search, use the 'Contains' condition.\nThe Data field you want to test is also a unique identifier in QuickBooks. In this case, Customer ID is used. For every Customer in QuickBooks, there is a unique ID. Thus, if the 'Search' action finds a customer in QuickBooks with a corresponding name, the Customer ID is sure to exist.\nIf a customer is found, the Customer ID will be present. In this case, we want to update this record in QuickBooks. This can be used to update information such as the Customer's phone number, email, billing/shipping addresses etc.\nIn step 4, if a Customer is not found, we want to create a new customer record using existing information from Salesforce.\n\n"},"recipes/rate-limiting.html":{"url":"recipes/rate-limiting.html","title":"Rate limiting","keywords":"","body":"Rate limiting\nMost APIs have a cap on the number of API calls you can make within a certain period. These limits usually differ by app.\nIn cases whereby the rate limits may have been reached, the particular trigger or action will throw an error in Workato when made. In such cases, the error is typically explicit about being a rate limit error.\nTo remedy such errors, you might want to look into optimizing your recipes to make minimal calls (by reducing the number of actions done with that particular app). If it occurs frequently, you might want to increase your API rate limits for that app.\n"},"formulas.html":{"url":"formulas.html","title":"Data types and formulas","keywords":"","body":"Formulas\nUsers can use formulas to transform data using Workato.

It returns the date for the start of the month for the given date/timestamp.\n\n\nBeginning of Next Month\nTo retrieve a date for the beginning of the next month, we simply need to add a month to the input date, and use the previously mentioned function get the beginning of the month.\n\n\nEnd of current or next month\nWhile the beginning_of_month function will always give you the first day of the month, retrieving the end of the month is a little trickier because some months have 31 days while others have less.\nInstead, we can apply some simple arithmetic to obtain the last date of the month.\nTo retrieve the last date of the current month:\n\nTo retrieve the last date of the next month:\n\nDisplay conversion\nstrftime\nTo change the format of a datetime value to suit your preferences, you can use the .strftime formula to do so.\nExample\n\n\n\nExample\nResult\n\n\n\n\n\"2017-06-05T17:13:27+00:00\".strftime(\"%B %e, %I:%M%p\")\nJune 5, 5:13pm\n\n\n\"2017-06-05T17:13:27+00:00\".strftime(\"%A, %d %B %Y %k:%M\")\nMonday, 05 June 2017 17:13\n\n\n\nAs shown above, each code (%B, %e, %I etc.) refers to a specific element of datetime.

Take note that most formulas will return an error and stop the job if it tries to operate on nulls (expressed as nil in Ruby), except for present?, presence and blank?.\nYou can refer to the complete Ruby documentation for arrays (lists) here as well as the Ruby documentation for hashes here.\nLists (arrays)\nArrays are ordered, integer-indexed collections of any object. List indexing starts at 0. Lists are the same as Ruby arrays, and we will be using lists and arrays interchangeably in this article.\nLet's take the example of a list with 4 list items: 100, 101, 102, 103. This list is expressed as:\nnumber_list = [100, 101, 102, 103, 104]\n\nAs lists are ordered, we can use the following formula to get the values. Workato only supports retrieving up to the fifth item in the list:\n\n\n\nExample\nResult\n\n\n\n\nnumber_list.first\n100\n\n\nnumber_list.second\n101\n\n\nnumber_list.third\n102\n\n\nnumber_list.fourth\n103\n\n\nnumber_list.fifth\n104\n\n\nnumber_list.last\n104\n\n\n\nWe can also use indexes to get corresponding values. Remember, indexes start at 0:\n\n\n\nExample\nResult\n\n\n\n\nnumber_list[0]\n100\n\n\nnumber_list[1]\n101\n\n\nnumber_list[2]\n102\n\n\nnumber_list[3]\n103\n\n\n\nLists in Ruby supports negative indexes.\n\n\n\nExample\nResult\n\n\n\n\nnumber_list[-1]\n104\n\n\nnumber_list[-2]\n103\n\n\nnumber_list[-3]\n102\n\n\nnumber_list[-4]\n101\n\n\n\nLists also support ranges as indexes. This returns another list, instead of returning only a value.\n\n\n\nExample\nResult\n\n\n\n\nnumber_list[0..2]\n[100, 101, 102]\n\n\nnumber_list[-3..-1]\n[102, 103, 104]\n\n\nnumber_list[0..-2]\n[100, 101, 102]\n\n\n\nHashes\nA hash is a dictionary-like collection of unique keys and their values. They are similar to Lists, but where a List uses integers as its index, a Hash allows you to use any object type. Hashes enumerate their values in the order that the corresponding keys were inserted.\nLet's take the example of a hash with 2 values, with item_name as \"Acme widgets\" and item_quantity as 10.\nline_item = { item_name: “Acme widgets”, item_qty: 10 }\n\n\n\n\nExample\nResult\n\n\n\n\nline_item[“item_name”]\n\"Acme widgets”\n\n\nline_item[“item_qty”]\n10\n\n\n\nList of hashes\nIn Workato, you will mostly run into lists of hashes. Let’s look at a Quickbooks invoice which has a number of line items. It will be represented as an list of hashes.\nline_items = [                                     # list\n  { item_name: “Acme widgets”, item_qty: 10  },    # hash 1\n  { item_name: “RR bearings”,  item_qty: 100 },    # hash 2\n  { item_name: “Coyote tyres”, item_qty: 7   }     # hash 3\n]\n\nFormulas\nWorkato supports a variety of list formulas. Formulas in Workato are whitelisted Ruby methods, and therefore not all Ruby methods are supported. You can always reach out to us to add additional formulas to the whitelist.

Workato can act as the intermediary to move files from one app to another, as well as extract data from text files and parse it for use in Workato. For example, a recipe can retrieve CSV file content, parse it and make it available within Workato so it can be transformed and moved to another app.\nSome examples of text files commonly worked with:\n\nTabular data: CSV\nDocuments: txt, rtf\nWeb standards: html, XML, JSON\n\nBinary files\nBinary files refer to any file which is not human readable. Unlike text files where Workato parses the content to understand the structure of data, with binary files, Workato does not interpret the content, e.g. Workato cannot read and interpret an image file, but it can upload the entire file into Salesforce as an attachment.\nSome examples of binary files commonly used:\n\nImages: jpg, png, gif, bmp, psd\nDocuments: pdf, doc, docx, ppt, xls, odt\n\nMoving text/binary files as-is between apps\nWhen moving files across apps without interpreting the content, it works the same for text or binary files. Workato has 2 approaches:\n\nBy passing on a URL to the destination app, so this data does not have to move through Workato. This URL will have to be publicly accessible and can disappear afer the job has completed.\nBy uploading content from app to Workato, and then downloading to the other app. This is not a great approach for working with very large files, as all the data has to move into the recipe, across every recipe step and then to the destination app.\n\nMoving text/binary files via public URL\nThis is typically a 2-step process:\n\nGet the public URL of the file to move. Generally found in the trigger or action output. e.g. New file trigger output contains a URL.\n\nPass in this public URL to the destination app. Generally an Upload file via URL action.\n\n\nExample\nLet's take the scenario where we move new files from Dropbox to Box. This is how the recipe looks.\n\nRecipe moves files from Dropbox to Box via public URLs. Example recipe\nThe Obtain a direct URL to file field in the New file trigger should be marked, so as to generate a public URL for the new file. The recipe then verifies that the file does not already exist in Box before uploading the file into Box via URL.\n\nObtain a direct URL for the Box file, then map the URL to the Box file to the upload action. Example recipe\nMoving text/binary files via file content\nThis is typically a 2-step process:\n\nDownload the file content of the file to move. Generally found in the datatree output of New file triggers.\n\nPass in this public URL to the destination app. Generally a Upload file via content action.\n\n\nExample of moving text/binary files via file content\nLet's take the scenario where email attachments need to be moved from Gmail to Box. This is how the recipe looks.\n\nRecipe moves Gmail attachments to Box. Example recipe\nFrom the New email trigger output, each email event that comes in has potentially a list of attachments. Therefore, the conditional action checks if the email has attachments. If not, nothing is processed for that email. In this case, the datapill from the attachment list in New email trigger is used. As the pills within a list refer to the first list item in that list (e.g. the first attachment within the list of attachments) unless when used in a for each step or in an input array, this allows us to verify if there's at least one attachment in the list.\n\nCheck if email contains at least one attachment. Example recipe\nIn cases whereby the email event has one or more attachments, the for each step ensures that the recipe iterates through the list of attachments, and that for each attachment, the attachment content is downloaded from Gmail before being uploaded into Box.\n\nIf email contains attachments, download each attachment from Gmail using attachment ID, and upload attachment content to Box. Example recipe\nIn this case, file content is used as Gmail does not provide public URLs to attachments. For scenarios where the source app provides public URLs to files and the target app accepts URLs for file uploads, moving of files via URLs should be the preferred method for recipe efficiency.\nExample of using Utilities to download file from public URL\nThe Utilities connector has a Download file from URL action that retrieves file content, given a public URL to a file. In cases whereby the file source app provides only a public URL to the file, but the destination app requires the actual file content, this action can be used.\nLet's take the scenario where new files created in a shared Box folder needs to be uploaded and associated with a Salesforce account. This is how the recipe looks.\n\nRecipe that uses Utilities to download file content. Example recipe\nThe recipe uses the public URL to the Box file to download the file content. This file content is then uploaded into Salesforce as a new attachment, associated to a certain Salesforce account (the account ID is hardcoded in this instance).\n\nDownload file using Box URL, then upload file content to Salesforce. Example recipe\nBase64 encoding\nBase64 encoding is a way of converting binary content into a set of standard characters for sending over networks. Certain apps require base64-encoded file content to be uploaded, and usually these same apps will produce base64-encoded file content when their files are downloaded.\nWorkato supports the ability to encode or decode base64 content via formulas.\nTo base64 encode binary content and upload it into such apps:\n\nFormula for encoding file content\nTo decode binary content from base64 content from such apps:\n\nFormula for decoding file content\nInterpreting file content and moving to other apps\nWhen working with text files, Workato and interpret the content of the file and convert individual elements to the data tree pills to make it easier to transform and send to other apps.\nExample\nThe following recipe creates a NetSuite inventory object by using data from a CSV file.\n\nRecipe reads CSV file. Example recipe\nWhen using Box new CSV file trigger, the expected columns in CSV files has to be declared for Workato to know how the data is structured. From this declaration, Workato builds the trigger output datatree.\n\nDefining the expected columns in the CSV files that the recipe will pick up.

An example of such a connector is the Box connector. With such connectors, you can simply listen to new CSV files and parse them via the same Workato trigger to move the data into another app.\nExample\nIn the following recipe, the Box trigger New CSV file will be used to read the sample CSV file from a Box folder and parse it to Workato as a list of three CSV lines. To try it out, create a CSV file with the above CSV sample and upload into a specific Box folder for the New CSV file trigger to pick up.\nNote - even if you have CSV files with other schema and different header lines in the selected folder and sub-folders, the New CSV file trigger will pick up those CSV files as well and attempt to process them with the header specified. This may lead to job errors or bad data being moved into your app. Ensure that you're only picking up the files you want by keeping all the relevant CSV files in the monitored folder, or by adding a trigger filter to filter only files to pick up.\nThe following recipe parses new CSV files in Box and uses the data parsed to create new NetSuite inventory items.\n\nRecipe that parses CSV files to retrieve data for use in datatree. Example recipe\nWhen using Box new CSV file trigger, the expected columns in CSV files has to be declared for Workato to know how the data is structured.

These variables can be used to map into subsequent recipe steps.\n\nUsing the variables created from the columns definition. Example recipe\nParsing CSV files via Utility connector's CSV parsing capability\nNot all connectors are able to process CSV files in particular and move individual values from these CSV files into other apps. Such connectors will have triggers that process only files in general. In such cases, we can still try to read the text content of CSV files and parse them explicitly with the Utility connector. This will allow us to move individual values from these CSV files into other apps, for example, from the sample CSV file:\nSierra Gardening\nMS-323\nCherry\nNatural\nExample\nIn the following recipe, Dropbox files triggered upon are not being parsed in the trigger, hence the additional need to download the content of the file and parse the CSV content for Workato to use. Parsing the CSV lines provides us with a list of lines (with each line having their own set of inventory item values) to utlize, hence we use a Repeat step to iterate through the list of lines and to create an inventory item with each set of values.\n\nRecipe that uses CSV file parsing utility. Example recipe\nIn the Parse CSV action, provide the file content to the CSV body input field, and specify the header line.\n\nField mapping for the Parse CSV action\nThe header line specified tells Workato how your CSV file's data looks. In this case, we can parse the following line into the proper variables datapill, such that \"Sierra Gardening\" corresponds to \"Manufacturer\", \"MS-322\" corresponds to \"Model\", etc.\nSierra Gardening, MS-322, Gardening supplies, Cherry wood potting bench, MS-322, Oakwood potting bench, 74.50, 119.99, Yes, 0.0875, Cherry, Natural, 30 inches\nThe Parse CSV action's datatree returns a list of CSV lines.\n\nOutput datatree for Parse CSV action showing the variables defined in the header line\nIn order to iterate through this list of CSV lines, we have to use a Repeat step.

To get high throughput you want to match batch triggers with batch actions.\nBatch processing triggers and actions are supported in certain connectors, such as database connectors (SQL Server, MySQL, etc.), cloud storage connectors that work with CSV files (e.g. Box, Amazon S3), Salesforce connector, etc.\nBatch triggers\nBatch triggers are similar to polling triggers in fetching trigger events. However, where polling triggers have trigger events corresponding to a single record, batch triggers have trigger events corresponding to a list of records. Maximum batch size can usually be defined in the trigger configuration.\nEach poll will fetch up to the maximum batch size specified. When less records are available, the trigger event will have less records.\nThis group of records is made available as a list within the job.\nBatch trigger example\nThe Salesforce batch trigger has a default value of 100. In this case, each trigger event will contain a maximum 100 account records.\n\nBatch trigger with a batch size of 100\nThe job details for each trigger event will contain the specific details of only the first and last record in the list.\n\nJob details - trigger output for a batch of new accounts in Salesforce\n For example, when the following recipe was first started, 843 records were fetched from 1 Jan 2015, midnight PST. These records were broken up into 8 trigger events of 100 records each, and 1 trigger event of 43 records. The next poll, 5 minutes later, fetched only 2 new account records created.\n\nCustom job report displaying account batches' details - names of first and last accounts in the batch, as well as batch size\nBatch actions\nBatch actions are typically of the form Create batch or Update batch or Upsert batch. Accordingly, these actions create a list of new records, update a list of existing records, or upsert (create if record doesn't exist, update if record exists) a list of records.\nBatch create actions\nBatch create actions create multiple records in a single action (typically corresponding to a single API call). Batch create actions usually accept a list of records as input, therefore typically recipes will:\n\nmove a list of records from source app to target app, or\nprepare a list of records via building and accumulating data in a custom list, then moving that prepared list into the target app\n\nBatch create action example\nThe following is an example scenario that imports new products from a Box CSV file into Salesforce via the Bulk insert action.\n\nExample recipe using list input. Example recipe\nActions that take lists as inputs will have a input field called Source list, which will only take in list pills. When these list input fields are selected, the datatree changes to offer only list pills. The Rows list object pill is mapped into the Salesforce product source list input field.\n\nRows list object is mapped into the Salesforce products input source list\nFor the list object passed into the input source list, the list will be transferred from the source app to the target app, with the values being trasnferred based on the fields mapped in the recipe. The three inventory items will be moved from Box into Salesforce as products.\n\nMapping of list datapills to list input\nThe following shows the CSV file content.\n\nTrigger output details displaying lines within the CSV file\nThe action output in the job history shows that three products have been created accordingly in Salesforce.\n\nSalesforce bulk insert via list input\n"},"user-accounts-and-teams/team-collaboration.html":{"url":"user-accounts-and-teams/team-collaboration.html","title":"Teams and collaboration","keywords":"","body":"Team collaboration\nTeam feature enables multiple users to work on the same Workato account and collaborate on recipes in a shared workspace.

They are able to add, edit and delete recipes, connections, SDK, API keys and on-prem agents. In addition, admins have administrative rights over the team and are able to invite collaborators or edit collaborators' roles.\nThe admin role is typically given to users managing the Workato team account.\nAnalyst role\nAnalysts have no access to team administration nor API keys. They are able to add and edit recipes, connections, SDK, as well as start and stop the on-prem agents.\nThe analyst role is typically given to users building and testing integration recipes or custom connectors on Workato.\nOperator role\nOperators only have access to view recipes and jobs, as well as start and stop recipes and rerun jobs.\nThe operator role is typically given to users maintaining the recipe and ensuring the recipes are running well.\nCustom roles\nIn addition to the default team roles, you can also define custom roles. These allow you to assign fine-grained permission sets to collaborators. You can create new roles on the team page.\n\nManage your roles and create new roles in the roles tab within the Team feature\nWhen creating a new role, select the specific create, edit and delete rights for recipe assets. In addition, select the additional Workato features within the team account you would like the collaborators to have access to.\n\nAdditional role access to Workato features\nYou can also define the folders, and correspondingly the recipes and connections contained in that folder, that the role will have access to. This is useful when there are multiple teams working on the same Workato account, such as development, QA and production teams in the recipe development lifecycle, or when different departments in the company wishes to manage their recipes separately. Users assigned to those folders will not have access to other folders nor to the Home folder.\n\nDefine folder permissions for the new role\nInvite collaborators\nTo invite collaborators, provide the full name of the collaborator and their email.\n\nInvite collaborators to the team\nExisting Workato users will be prompted to login to Workato and accept the team invite.\nNon-Workato users will be prompted to sign up for a Workato account.\nSwitching between personal accounts and team accounts\nTeam members will be able to view the teams they are collaborating on in their account menu, as well as their roles in the team.

This would involve moving recipes from a development environment to a testing environment, or from a testing environment to a production/deployment environment.\nOn Workato, teams can move sets of recipes and their related assets (e.g. connections, callable recipes, custom connectors) from one environment to another, via the use of packages. This allows teams to maintain their integration recipes across their different teams' environments.\nPackages\nA package refers to a grouping of assets, which refers to recipes and the related dependencies needed for recipes to work, e.g. connections, custom connectors, lookup tables and account properties. With the packages feature, users can move these assets easily across different Workato accounts.\nPackages are useful when teams are collaborating across different Workato accounts, for example, if the development team wishes to move recipes over to the QA team's Workato account, or to the production Workato account. Consultants can also utilize this feature to move comprehensive integrations into their clients' accounts.\nThe packages feature is enabled only for certain Workato plans. Check the Pricing and plans page or reach out to Workato sales representatives at +1 (844) 469-6752 to find out more.\nFor Workato accounts with the packages feature enabled, users will be able to see the import/export option on their account menu.\n\nPackages menu option\nUpon clicking the Import/export option on the menu, you'll be brought into the packages page.\n\nPackages page with import and export functions\nExporting packages\nWhen you export a folder of recipes as a zip file, you will find:\n\nrecipes in that folder\nsubfolders and recipes in those subfolders\nassociated connections\nassociated custom connectors\nassociated callable recipes\nall account properties\nall lookup tables\n\nTo begin exporting your recipes, ensure that all the recipes you wish to export are grouped together in a Workato folder. All associated connections, custom connectors and callable recipes will also be bundled into the package automatically. All account properties and lookup tables in that Workato account are also bundled into the package. Once the package is created, the user can download the package in a zip file.\nIn the example below, 2 recipes can be found in the Customer Sync folder. In these recipes, the user utilizes assets such as callable recipes and lookup tables.\nTo export a folder as a package, click on the Export button.

Check the Pricing and Plans page or reach out to Workato sales representatives at +1 (844) 469-6752 to find out more.\nFor Workato accounts with on-prem access, users are able to view the on-prem option on their account menu.\n\nOn premise menu option\nOn-premise overview\nThe following is a conceptual model of Workato's on-premise agent and how it interacts with databases and applications behind the firewall.\n\nConceptual model for on-prem agent and connector\nWorkato on-premise connectivity has 2 core components:\n\nTunneling\nDatabase and filesystem access.\n\nThe on-prem agent runs within the customer’s data center, behind the firewall, and establishes a TLS websocket tunnel to connect out to Workato.\nThe on-prem agent can be configured to access the selected databases and filesystems behind the firewall. Since 2.2.x it also supports connections to JMS-compliant systems.\nSupported operating systems\nThe on-prem agent runs on the following systems:\n\nLinux (64-bit)\n\nWindows 7, 10 (64-bit)\n\nMac OS X\n\n\nMinimum hardware requirements for the system running the on-prem agent are:\n\n8GB of RAM\n250 MB of disk space\n800 Mhz 64-bit CPU (Intel/AMD).\n\nPlease make sure that TCP port 3000 is available for binding.\nSetting up on-prem access\n\nInstall agent\n\nCreate connection profiles\n\nStart agent\n\n\nInstall agent\nWindows\n\nClick on Windows agent button to download and run the installer. Follow the installation instructions.\nBy default, the agent is installed into C:\\Program Files\\Workato Agent folder and creates a Workato group in the Start Menu.\nBy default, the agent is installed as a Windows service called WorkatoAgent. You can disable this feature by unchecking the corresponding option during install.\nClick on Download key button. Unzip the cert.zip file to \\conf directory ( is a target folder you've selected during install). This should copy cert.key and cert.pem files to the directory.\n\nAn installation instruction video for Windows is also available here.\nLinux\n\nClick on Linux agent button. Unpack the agent package file to .\nClick on Download key button. Unzip the cert.zip file to /conf directory. This should copy cert.key and cert.pem files to the directory.\n\nCreate connection profiles\nA single Workato agent can be used to connect with multiple backend apps. A connection profile uniquely identifies the back end app and contains the configuration information required to connect to that app.\nEdit /conf/config.yml file to configure your database connection profiles and filesystem access.\ndatabase:\n  profile1:\n    ...\n  profile2:\n    ...\n\nfiles:\n  profile1:\n    ...\n  profile2:\n    ...\n\nDatabase connection profile\nDatabase connection profiles are located in the database section of /conf/config.yml.\nThe following databases are supported by the on-prem agent:\n\nmysql for MySQL\nsqlserver for Microsoft SQL Server\noracle for Oracle Database\npostgresql for PostgreSQL.\n\nA database type is specified either by adapter property or a complete JDBC URL provided in the url property.\nPort numbers can be omitted when matching defaults for a given database type.\nThe example below has a connection profile named marketing. Do not use spaces or special characters in connection profile names.\nSQL Server URL-based sample configuration for connecting to specific instance:\ndatabase:\n  sales:\n    url: jdbc:sqlserver://server\\instance;databaseName=sales\n    username: joe\n    password: Secret123\n    ApplicationName: workato\n\nPostgreSQL URL-based sample configuration:\ndatabase:\n  sales:\n    url: jdbc:postgresql://sales.database:5432/sales\n    username: joe\n    password: Secret123\n    ApplicationName: workato\n\nJMS connection profile\nJMS connection profiles are located in the jms section of /conf/config.yml.\nA JMS provider is specified by provider property of a connection profile.\nThe following JMS providers are supported by the on-prem agent:\n\namazon-sqs or sqs for Amazon Simple Queue Service\nactivemq for Apache ActiveMQ.\n\nAmazon SQS\nYou need the following configuration properties when connecting to Amazon SQS:\njms:\n  MyAmazonProfile:\n    provider: amazon-sqs\n    region: \n    accessKey: \n    secretKey: \n\nNote that you need to make sure your SQS queue is created before sending messages.\nApache ActiveMQ\nFor connecting to a running ActiveMQ broker you only need to specify broker URL:\njms:\n  MyActiveMQProfile:\n    provider: activemq\n    url: tcp://localhost:61616\n\nActiveMQ broker cannot be embedded into the agent. Using any vm:// broker connections is not supported.\nOn-premise files connection profile\nWorking with on-prem files requires you to define a filesystem profile in the files section.\nYou need to specify the base folder for file access; the base folder will be used for resolving relative paths.\nfiles:\n  hrfiles:\n    base: \"C:/Documents/HR\"\n\nFor example, if we were to access the on-prem-file folder on the Desktop, the configuration will have a file path that looks something like this: \n\nConfiguration of on-prem-file folder on Desktop\nThe file path can be found when you right-click on the folder, and select get info or property.\nPassword encryption\nTo avoid exposure of any sensitive data (like passwords) you have a choice to encrypt it by using the encryptor tool. The process of encrypting any secret value is as follows:\n\nMake sure you have your agent keys properly downloaded and placed into conf folder. They are required for encryption.\nRun the encryptor tool. Use bin\\encryptor.cmd in Windows, bin/encryptor.sh script for Unix/MacOS.\nWhen prompted, enter your secret value twice.\nThe script will print an encrypted text.\nExample:{encrypted: 'RCVtuGPjJWNqwkFQvhT...'}\n\nCopy and paste the provided text as a value inside config.yml. Make sure your value is one-line.\nFor example, in a database profile:database:\n  sales:\n    url: jdbc:postgresql://sales.database:5432/sales\n    username: joe\n    password: {encrypted: 'RCVtuGPjJWNqwkFQvhT...'}\n\n\n\nThe encryption is based on your agent's private key. You cannot use encrypted value from one agent inside another agent's configuration. Note that only YAML values can be encrypted (you cannot encrypt YAML property keys).\nProxy server support\nThe on-prem agent can be run in the environment with limited internet connectivity by using a proxy server.\nProxy settings can be defined by adding a top-level proxy section to the configuration file:\nproxy:\n  host: 192.168.1.1\n  port: 8080\n  username: proxy_user\n  password: proxy_password\n\n(username and password are optional)\nUsing a proxy server for establishing a secure tunnel requires a support for CONNECT feature; make sure the proxy server is configured to allow CONNECT requests to the Workato gateway (sg.workato.com).\nAccessing HTTPS resources\nhttp configuration section allows configuring agent access to internal HTTPS resources:\nhttp:\n  trustAll: true\n  verifyHost: true\n\nThe agent may be configured to allow accessing internal HTTPS resources which use self-signed certificates. To enable self-signed certificates set trustAll property to true.\nNormally a server certificate's Common Name (or Subject Alternate Name) field should match the target hostname. If you want the agent to accept server certificates with non-matching hostname, disable hostname verification by setting verifyHost property to false (defaults to true).\nApplying new configuration\nA running on-prem agent automatically applies any changes made to the configuration file. Changes to proxy server settings require you to restart the agent.\nStart agent\nWindows 64-bit\nThe on-prem agent can be run as a Windows console application or as a Windows service.\nRun the on-prem agent in console mode by launching by Workato → Run Agent (console) shortcut in the Start Menu.\nYou can use Run Agent (console) shortcut to ensure the agent is successfully connecting to Workato using the provided certificate.\nUsing Windows Service\n\nInstaller automatically registers the agent as a Windows service called WorkatoAgent.\nNote: Workato agent is not auto-started by default. Open Control Panel → System and Security → Administrative Tools → Services → WorkatoAgent service configuration to configure service auto-start.\n\nBrowsing log files\n\nWhen the on-prem agent is running as a Windows service, log files can be found at: %SYSTEMROOT%\\System32\\LogFiles\\Workato. There's also a shortcut to Workato log directory in the Workato group found in Start Menu for convenience.\n\nLinux 64-bit and Mac OS X\nRun the on-prem agent using the following bash script:\n/bin/run.sh\nCreating connections\nThere are no differences in how you work with on-prem apps within your recipe, but on-prem app connections do require special configuration. An on-prem app connection needs to point to a on-prem agent and a specific connection profile.\nConnecting to database profiles\nSelect the correct on-prem agent from the pick list. Once you select the on-prem agent, enter the connection profile name as entered in the database section of the config.yml configuration file.\n\nConnecting to on-premise file system profiles\nYou can customize your connection name. Under the on-prem secure agent and connection profile, provide the corresponding agent name and connection profile respectively. Next, click on connect.

You can lookup an entry within the specified lookup table by using:\n\nAny column\nMultiple columns\n\nFor example, if I'm trying to move accounting entries from my sales app into my accounting app i.e. Salesforce to Intacct, I might find that both departments are using different account codes internally. In order to ensure data is synced accurately from Salesforce into Intacct, I would need to take the account codes from Salesforce, find the matching codes in Intacct, and create the Intacct accounting entries using the corresponding Intacct account codes. In the following table, any Salesforce entries coming in with the code 34267 will be written into Intacct under the code 6754.\n\nLookup table with the account ID in Salesforce, account ID in Intacct, and the account names\nSome other scenarios where you might need lookup tables:\n\nGiven a city name, you want to get the zip code\nGiven a metric unit, you want to convert to SI for distances\nGiven a department and rank, you want to retrieve vacation accrual rates\n\nLookup tables are enabled only for certain plans.

This connector supports adding of new entries via a recipe.\nUsing the lookup table connector\nThe Lookup table utility connector allows you to work with your tables via recipes. This connector supports the following actions:\n\nLookup entry\nSearch entries\nAdd entry\n\nAdd entry action\nAdd a new entry to an existing lookup table. You can use this action to keep your lookup tables updated, e.g. read newly created job titles from your human resources application and create a new entry for that job title in your lookup table.\n\nSelect the lookup table to write to and then input the values to provide for each cell of the row\nLookup entry action\nThe lookup entry action allows you to search for an entry (a row in the lookup table) by any of its values. The lookup entry action behaves like a search and retrieves a single entry. The first matching entry depends on the values passed in. If you have duplicate entries (i.e. your lookup will return more than one entry), only one entry will be retrieved.\nIn the example below, we have a table called Vacation Rules with 4 columns - vacation type, department ID, job code and job title.\n\nUsing the lookup entry action in the recipe\nIn the following gif, we configure the lookup entry table to search for a specific row that matches the values we have (in that job) for department ID and job code. In the subsequent step, we can see what's returned - a single entry with all 4 available values. If we were looking for the corresponding vacation type and job title, we can use those datapills from the datatree.\nThe following gif walks you through the flow of configuring the lookup entry action to retrieve a matching entry.\n\nConfiguring the action to lookup entries with the matching department ID and job code\nSearch entries action\nThe search entries action works similarly to the lookup action. The main difference between them is that lookup action returns a single entry whereas the search entries action returns a list of entries.\nUse this if you expect a list of matching entries to be returned, and wish to process the list accordingly.\nLookup table formulas\nInstead of using an action step to carry out the entry lookup, you can also use a formula to lookup entries in your lookup table. This is as efficient as the lookup action and can be done within the input field without requiring additional actions.\nTo use the formula, set the input field to formula mode, and enter the formula in this format:\nlookup(table name,column name for search: data pill)[column name for result]\nPerforming lookup on in memory table\nOutput of search entries can be used as in memory lookup table. In memory lookup function is useful when a recipe invokes the lookup function on the same lookup table 1000s of times. \nTo use the lookup formula on a in memory table, set the input field to formula mode, and enter the formula in this format:\nlookup(entries pill from search entries action,column name for search: data pill)[column name for result]\n\nUsing the lookup table formula to lookup entries in table Test\nLimits\nEach lookup table supports up to 5 columns of data.

It's a way to decompose your recipes into smaller recipes, to help simplify as well as enable reuse (i.e. callable recipe can be called from multiple recipes)\nUnlike other recipes that are started by a trigger event, callable recipe steps are executed when the recipe is called from another recipe.\nCallable recipes can also be accessed via REST API.\nAdvantages of using callable recipes\n\nEasier to test\nBy using a single block/loop in a separate recipe instead of repeating the single block/loop multiple times within a recipe, you just have to change the code in one place and test it instead of multiple places in the recipe.\n\nMaking recipes more readable\nInstead of having really long recipes, break it out into smaller recipes that can be called\n\nSharing across recipes\nIf you have a standard error notification policy, you can create a recipe and then have all recipes call this recipe for error notification\n\nSharing across accounts and with business partners\nYou can expose REST APIs to your business partners. e.g. a REST API that provides inventory status to your suppliers.\n\n\nUsing callable recipes\nLet’s take a look at an example to see how this works. Say you want to automate the process of creating an invoice in Quickbooks Online (QBO) when an opportunity is closed-won in Salesforce. The recipe logic would be\nCreate a new customer if customer does not exist\nIn order to create a QBO invoice, you’ll need to create a new customer if the customer does not already exist in QBO. Now, this snippet of logic: “creating a customer in QBO when they don’t already exist,” is a process that is necessary not only with your Salesforce to QBO integrations, but also when you have Point Of Sale (POS) transactions flowing into QBO, invoices you receive from your vendors and more. Instead of recreating the logic for “creating a customer in QBO when they don’t already exist,” you can make this snippet of logic into a Callable Recipe.\nStep 1. Create a new recipe\nCreate a recipe as you normally would, and for the trigger, select Callable Recipe under the application picklist.\n\nSelect callable recipe connector and call recipe action\nFill in a Name for the recipe, and fill up the Input Schema and the Response Schema in the JSON Format. You can find out more about JSON here.\n\nIn simple terms, the input schema determines what fields will be shown and need to be filled in when a callable recipe action is created in the calling recipe. The Response schema determines what pills will be available for use in the calling recipes Output data.\nLastly, you may choose to enable REST endpoint for your recipe. This defaults to No\n[\nNext, create your set of actions for the recipe. For this example you would create a set of standard de-duplication stpes, Run a search, and if search gives no results, create a customer, if exisiting customer found, update customer. For a sample recipe, click here https://www.workato.com/recipes/485991\nStep 2: Call recipe\nCreate a recipe that requires the logic from the callable recipe we created earlier. Set up the trigger as required, and when created the actions you need. When you need to call the callable recipe, simply click on Add a new step, select call recipe, choose the recipe you created earlier, and you will see the fields from your input schema appear. Simply drag and drop the required pills and you'll be good to go!\n\nCalling Recipes from Other Apps with REST API\nEnabling a REST endpoint for recipes makes it available to be called by any application, internal or external, as long as they have the API token to do so. The token ensures the security of your API. Choosing to build simple web and mobile apps using Workato and a REST Endpoint takes out a majority of the custom coding that would be involved and ensures a fast turnaround. There are two ways you can use a REST Endpoint:\n\nBring Information Into An App\nYou can connect any app that has an API available with a REST Endpoint even if Workato doesn’t have a connector for that app. For example, if you want to bring in information from Zillow.com so you know how much a real estate property is worth, you can create a REST Endpoint that will populate your fields in QuickBase every time an employee run the recipe.You can also create a button that will start the REST Endpoint recipe. You can place the button wherever you would like, for example inside of Salesforce, so employees can tell the recipe to run without logging into Workato.\n\nSend Information Out Of An App\nAnother scenario where this is useful is monitoring a supply chain – you could have a business partner call upon the REST endpoint you created to track shipping or generate a report via a link on your internal website. You can embed this anywhere you want.\n\n\nTo manage the REST endpoints and the API tokens, go to “Service Catalog” under your username on the right hand corner of the screen. Here, you can easily test your REST endpoints and find the specific URL used to call the REST API. These screenshots will show you a more detailed view of REST API management:\n"},"features/account-properties.html":{"url":"features/account-properties.html","title":"Account properties","keywords":"","body":"Account properties\nAccount properties allow you to store account wide recipe configuration parameters.

Next, you can create a repeat action any time after the Create list action. Then, use the list pill from the create list step's output in the Input list field. Once you have configured your recipe, it will repeat the set of actions the same number of times as the size of the list.\nDownload file from URL\nDownloading a file in a recipe allows you to use that file later in the recipe, usually to upload onto another app. However, downloaded text content can be used directly into the recipe. Downloading a file does not mean that you will see that file on your computer. It is merely download for use in a recipe. Take note the maximum file size you can download is 25MB.\nIn the Download file from URL section, you can provide a static URL if you intend to upload the same file to multiple places, (e.g. as an attachment to all Accounts in Salesforce) or provide a dynamic URL by using a URL pill obtained from a previous step output.

Create a CSV file with the above CSV sample and upload into a specific Box folder for the New CSV file trigger to pick up.\nIf the above CSV file is the only CSV file in the selected Box folder in the trigger configuration, the fields list will be populated automatically with the column names. The column names has to correspond exactly with the header line in the CSV file in order for the CSV data to be mapped accurately to their columns.\n\nDefining the expected columns in the CSV files that the recipe will pick up.

This identifies lists in the datatree.\n\nList icon within datatree\nThese datapills can be used to map into Workato actions' input fields. There are three ways to map datapills from lists:\n\ndirectly into an action without list processing\ninto an action with a list input (action handles list processing implicitly)\ninto an action with a Repeat step (action does not handle list processing, list processing needs to be done explicitly at the recipe logic level)\n\nUsing datapills from lists\nUsing datapills directly in an action without list processing\nWhen using pills directly from a list, only the values of the first list item will be retrieved. In the following recipe, pills from the list are used directly in the Log message action.\n\nRecipe using list pills directly in Log message action. Example recipe\n\nField mappings for Log message action\nIn the job details page, the trigger output displays all three lines within the CSV file.\n\nTrigger output details displaying lines within the CSV file\nAs the Log message action uses only datapills directly from the list, without handling the list in any way, only the first line's data is retrieved.\n\nLog message input displaying only the first line of data\nUsing datapills in an action with a list input (action handles list processing implicitly)\nSome actions will accept a list as input e.g. Salesforce bulk insert and bulk update actions, create journal entry actions for accounting apps, create sales order actions for ERP apps.\nThe following is an example scenario that imports new products from a Box CSV file into Salesforce via the Bulk insert action.\n\nExample recipe using list input. Example recipe\nActions that take lists as inputs will have a input field called Source list, which will only take in list pills. When these list input fields are selected, the datatree changes to offer only list pills. The Rows list object pill is mapped into the Salesforce product source list input field.\n\nRows list object is mapped into the Salesforce products input source list\nFor the list object passed into the input source list, the list will be transferred from the source app to the target app, with the values being trasnferred based on the fields mapped in the recipe. The three inventory items will be moved from Box into Salesforce as products.\n\nMapping of list datapills to list input\nThe following shows the CSV file content.\n\nTrigger output details displaying lines within the CSV file\nThe action output in the job history shows that three products have been created accordingly in Salesforce.\n\nSalesforce bulk insert via list input\nUsing datapills in an action with a Repeat step (action does not handle list processing, list processing needs to be done explicitly at the recipe logic level)\nIn this example scenario, let's import a list of new inventory items (recorded within a CSV file just uploaded into Box) into a NetSuite instance. There is a list to read from with the Box connector's New CSV file trigger, but no list processing capabilities in the NetSuite connector's Add inventory item action.\nIn order to move through the list and create three NetSuite inventory items, the Repeat step should be used to iterate through the list, and carry out the same action for each iteration.\n\nRecipe using repeat step to iterate through NetSuite list of inventory items. Example recipe\nTo iterate through the Rows list, pass the Rows list object as input for the repeat step. The recipe will therefore iterate through the list thrice to repeat the \"Add inventory item\" action thrice, with different values from different CSV lines each time.\n\nProvide the list object as input for repeat step\nWhen using the Repeat step, the important thing to note is to retrieve datapills from the For each datatree.\n\nMapping datapills from the Foreach datatree\nThis ensures that, when the list is being iterated through, the first Add inventory item step uses the first line:\nSierra Gardening, MS-321, Gardening supplies, Pine wood potting bench, MS-321, Oakwood potting bench, 74.50, 119.99, Yes, 0.0875, Pine, White, 30 inches\nThe second Add inventory item step uses the second line:\nSierra Gardening, MS-322, Gardening supplies, Cherry wood potting bench, MS-322, Oakwood potting bench, 74.50, 119.99, Yes, 0.0875, Cherry, Natural, 30 inches\nAnd the third Add inventory item step uses the third line:\nSierra Gardening, MS-323, Gardening supplies, Cedar wood potting bench, MS-323, Oakwood potting bench, 74.50, 119.99, Yes, 0.0875, Cedar, Black, 30 inches\nCommon mistake when using Repeat step\nAs discussed here, using pills directly from the list object in the datatree without list handling will result in the first list item being used. Hence, if datapills from the list object (instead of datapills from the Repeat step) are used inside the Repeat step, the recipe still iterates through the 3 CSV lines, but instead of using values from each line with every iteration, only values from the first line will be used for all 3 iterations, resulting in duplication.\n\nExample of a recipe with wrong direct mapping from list instead of from the Repeat step. Example recipe\nList connector (Accumulator)\nThe list connector is a Workato utility built for users to create custom lists and store data in the list for the duration of a job, to be used in the same job. It is usually used for users to prepare a list to write to an action with a list input.\nUsing the accumulator action to create a custom list\nDefining the list fields\nA custom list has to be created before data can be accumulated and stored within it. To create the list, select the List connector and its default action \nAppend item to list.\n\nAccumulator with no fields configured\nDefine the fields in the custom list by configuring field name, type and hint.\n\nAdding a string field to the accumulator list\n\nAdding a date field to the accumulator list\nAfter configuring the fields in the custom list, ensure that the list is within a Repeat step and that the datapills are mapped from the Repeat step's output datatree. This ensures that the iterated list items' values are mapped into the custom list accordingly, and that values are not being duplicated within the list because the wrong pills from the main datatree (as opposed to the Repeat step's datatree) were mapped as shown above.\n\nConfigured and mapped accumulator\nFields can be added or edited within custom lists anytime.\n\nFields can be added or edited in custom lists\nThe custom list can also be edited via its JSON representation.\n\nEditing the custom list's JSON representation\nExample recipes that use accumulator, list input and Repeat step\nLet's take the scenario whereby closed won Salesforce opportunities with a list of opportunity products need to be moved into NetSuite as sales orders with a similar list of line items.\nThe NetSuite connector's Create sales order action takes in a list of line items that reference the inventory items' internal NetSuite ID. This means that users similarly need to have a list of NetSuite inventory item IDs to create the NetSuite sales order in a single action. However, from Salesforce, only Salesforce opportunity products' IDs are available. In order to obtain the NetSuite inventory items' internal IDs, users would have to search for the correct NetSuite inventory item by its Salesforce opportunity product name, and then pass the NetSuite internal ID of the found NetSuite inventory item into the Create sales order action.\nThere are two ways of building this recipe:\n1) Using accumulator + list input. Iteratively build a custom list of NetSuite inventory items from the Saleforce opportunity product list, then create the complete NetSuite sales order with lines in a single action\nIterate through the Salesforce list of opportunity products via a Repeat step to find corresponding NetSuite inventory items, and accumulate that in a custom list. Subsequently, create a complete NetSuite sales order with a list of line items in a single action, by passing in the custom list built with accumulator.\n\nSalesforce-Netsuite recipe using Repeat step.

Alternatively, they can type help in the Workbot DM, and click on the personal accounts button. It is possible to disconnect personal connections or connect them again. Note, if not in the Workbot DM, you can type the same commands, but add the @Workbot mention, e.g. @Workbot connections or @Workbot help.\n\nPersonal connections management\nIf the command is ran by the Workbot admin (user who installed Workbot into Slack team), recipe will automatically be executed with the default recipe connection. Therefore, Workbot admins will not have personal connections.\n"},"workbot/workbot-troubleshooting.html":{"url":"workbot/workbot-troubleshooting.html","title":"Workbot troubleshooting","keywords":"","body":"Troubleshooting Workbot\nSometimes when interacting with Workbot, he may raise some errors or issues.

This sample output schema will be used to build the output datatree. This datatree allows you to use the data returned from the Lambda function in subsequent recipe actions.\nTo define the output schema, provide a sample response to the Response body input field. This should describe the data structure and schema of the output. There are 2 ways to configure this input field:\n\nUse a sample JSON\nManually define schema using the schema designer widget\n\n\nResponse body input field\nThis article focuses on defining the output schema via sample JSON. Clicking on generate from JSON sample brings up the following schema designer widget.\n\nSchema designer widget\nThere are two typical formats for a JSON:\n\nJSON response body\nSingle primitive data\n\nJSON response\nWorkato requires all data be presented as key & value pairs. This is done so that we can map values using its respective key. JSON data format is a good example. For the AWS Lambda connector, we require all response JSON to be wrapped in a parent \"response\" object. Hence using a given response like this:\n{\n  \"id\": 123,\n  \"name\": \"Ee Shan\",\n  \"email\": \"eeshan@workato.com\"\n}\n\nWrap it in a parent `\"response\" object:\n{\n  \"response\": {\n    \"id\": 123,\n    \"name\": \"Ee Shan\",\n    \"email\": \"eeshan@workato.com\"\n  }\n}\n\nInsert the output JSON and click Generate. This generates the following output datatree:\n\nJSON body output datatree\nPrimitive data response\nIf the Lambda function returns non-JSON data structure, like a single string, integer or a simple boolean value, it will likewise need to be wrapped in a parent \"response\" object. Let's look at a simple function that returns an integer value (ID for example). A sample response will be:\n4990\n\nWrap it in a parent \"response\" object:\n{\n  \"response\": 4990\n}\n\nInsert the output JSON and click Generate.

They can be obtained from the datatree of create object actions or search object actions.\n\nInternal ID of a specific sales order as seen in the URL\n\nExternal ID\n\nEvery NetSuite record has an external ID field to store the IDs of corresponding objects in other systems - for example, you can store the corresponding Salesforce ID of a NetSuite customer in that customer's external ID field.\nThis field is a standard field in NetSuite, but typically not visible by default in NetSuite.\n\nIDs\n\nWhen linking an object to another object via Workato (e.g. when creating a transaction and trying to link this transaction to a class, department or subsidiary), NetSuite usually asks for the IDs of the object you wish to link to. To find these IDs, you would typically need to search for these objects (e.g. in this case, to search for your class, department or subsidiary). Alternatively, you might want to store these values in a lookup table for easy reference without having to execute a search in your NetSuite instance.\n\nCustom fields\n\nThe recipe is able to retrieve the custom fields of your selected NetSuite object for you to read from or write to. All custom fields are grouped in Workato.\n\nCustom fields Tax Receipt No. and External ID\n\nItem list\n\nFor transaction objects that contains line items, the available fields within each line item can be found grouped within the item list field.\n\nItem list displayed in the create sales order action\nNew classification object trigger\nCertain objects in NetSuite are classification objects, such as departments, locations and classifications. Select the classification object to monitor.\nWhen the recipe is first started, all the existing instances of the selected object will be picked up by the recipe. Subsequently, only newly created instances will be processed by the recipe.\n\nNew classification object trigger\nFor example, if I select departments as the object to trigger upon, all existing department objects will be picked up by the trigger when the recipe is first ran. Subsequently, if the recipe is kept running, only departments which have been newly created will be picked up by the recipe.\nTrigger behaviour when recipe is stopped and restarted\nEven if the recipe is stopped, when it's restarted again, all departments created in the time during which the recipe was stopped will be picked up by the recipe.\nNew standard object and new custom object trigger\nThe new standard object and new custom object trigger are very similar, so this section will cover both.\nConfiguring the trigger\nTo use this trigger, we need to first select the standard object or the custom object to monitor. We also need to input the datetime in the From field to pinpoint the exact date from which the recipe should start processing records.\n\nNetSuite new object trigger - unconfigured. Select the object to monitor for newly created records.\nWhen the recipe is first started, all the existing instances of the selected object created after the datetime in the From field will be picked up by the recipe. Subsequently, only newly created instances will be processed by the recipe.\nFor example, I've selected sales order and 1 Jan, 2017 midnight for my trigger as below.\n\nNetSuite new object trigger - configured\nWhen I first start my recipe all sales orders created from or after 1 Jan, 2017 midnight, will be processed. Subsequently, if the recipe is kept running, only sales orders which have been newly created will be picked up by the recipe.\nTrigger behaviour when recipe is stopped and restarted\nEven if the recipe is stopped, when it's restarted again, all sales orders created in the time during which the recipe was stopped will be picked up by the recipe.\nNew/updated standard object and new/updated custom object trigger\nThe new/updated standard object and new/updated custom object trigger are very similar, so this section will cover both.\nConfiguring the trigger\nTo use this trigger, we need to first select the standard object or the custom object to monitor. We also need to input the datetime from the From field to pinpoint the exact date from which the recipe should start processing records.\n\nNetSuite new/updated object trigger - unconfigured. Select the object to monitor for newly created or updated records.\nWhen the recipe is first started, all the existing instances of the selected object created or updated after the datetime in the From field will be picked up by the recipe. Subsequently, any newly created instances or updated instances will be processed by the recipe.\nFor example, I've selected sales order and 1 Jan, 2017 midnight for my trigger as below.\n\nNetSuite new/updated object trigger - configured\nWhen I first start my recipe all sales orders created or updated from or after 1 Jan, 2017 midnight, will be processed. Subsequently, if the recipe is kept running, any sales orders which have been newly created or updated will be picked up by the recipe.\nTrigger behaviour when recipe is stopped and restarted\nEven if the recipe is stopped, when it's restarted again, all sales orders created or updated in the time during which the recipe was stopped will be picked up by the recipe. Do note, however, that the recipe will only pick up the last (most updated) version of search record. For example, if a record was newly created and had 3 updates made to it while the recipe was stopped, the recipe will only pick up the last updated version of the record when it's restarted again.\nNew saved search result for object trigger\nThe New saved search result for object trigger retrieves new records that meet the saved search's criteria, e.g. for a saved search that fetches customer records of industry type Hardware, new customers created of the industry type Hardware will be picked up as a trigger event.\nExisting customers whose industry type is changed to Hardware will also be picked up as a trigger event if their Date created value is valid for the recipe (falls after the datetime in the From field specified in the trigger).\nTo ensure the trigger works, we need to make sure that the columns Internal ID and Date created are configured as result columns in the saved search. To do this, navigate to the saved search page to edit it.\n\nEdit the saved search\nNavigate to the Results page's Columns section, and add the two fields to the list of columns if it's not there.\n\nAdd Internal ID and Date created columns in saved search for New trigger\nAlso, make sure to remove the Dashboard column in the saved search's results if it's present. Having this column will cause the trigger to throw an error.\n\nRemove Dashboard column in saved search\nOnce this setup has been done, we can proceed to configure the trigger. This configuration is similar to that for New/updated saved search result trigger:\n\nSelect the object type we wish to retrieve the saved searches for. In our case, we selected the customer object.\nOnce the object type has been selected, select the saved search to listen to for new records.\nSpecify the date time in the From field. Only records created after this From date will be retrieved by the recipe. This means that, when an existing record meets the saved search criteria, it will only be picked up by the recipe if it has a Date created value after the From value.\n\n\nConfigure the new saved search results trigger\nNew/updated saved search result for object trigger\nThe New/updated saved search result for object trigger retrieves new and updated records that meet the saved search's criteria, e.g. for a saved search that fetches customer records of industry type Hardware, new or updated customers of the industry type Hardware will be picked up as a trigger event.\nExisting customers whose industry type is changed to Hardware will also be picked up as a trigger event.\nTo ensure the trigger works, we need to make sure that the columns Internal ID and Last modified are configured as result columns in the saved search. To do this, navigate to the saved search page to edit it.\n\nAdd Internal ID and Last modified columns in saved search for New/updated trigger\nAlso, make sure to remove the Dashboard column in the saved search's results if it's present. Having this column will cause the trigger to throw an error.\n\nRemove Dashboard column in saved search\nOnce this setup has been done, we can proceed to configure the trigger. This configuration is similar to that for New saved search result trigger:\n\nSelect the object type we wish to retrieve the saved searches for. In our case, we selected the customer object.\nOnce the object type has been selected, select the saved search to listen to for new records.\nSpecify the datetime in the From field. Only records created or updated after this From date will be retrieved by the recipe.\n\n\nConfigure the new/updated saved search results trigger\nAdd standard object and add custom object action\nThe add standard object and add custom object actions are similar except that the former works with standard NetSuite objects, while the latter works with custom objects created by your organization.\nIn this section, we'll be covering how to use the add standard object action, which will be applicable for the add custom object action as well.\nConfiguring your add object action\nTo configure your action, first select the object you would like to create. In this case, let's create a sales order. After you have selected the object you wish to create, the recipe will retrieve the fields of your selected NetSuite object.\n\nNetSuite add object action - unconfigured. Select the object to create.\nSelecting and mapping your fields\nAfter selecting the object you wish to create, you'd need to select the specific fields you wish to write to when creating your NetSuite record.\n\nAfter selecting your object, select the specific fields you wish to write to\nTake note that some NetSuite fields are displayed with their internal API names instead of their labels in NetSuite. For example, entity ID refers to the customer/vendor to attach a transaction document to, while internal ID refers to the NetSuite ID of any object.\nIf you can't find the field you're looking for, check with your NetSuite admin or with us!\nSearch standard objects action\nThe search standard objects action will return a list of records that match the criteria given. If no matching record is found, the action will simply return an empty array.\nConfiguring the search standard objects action\nTo carry out a search standard object action, we would first need to tell the recipe exactly what standard object category and what specific object we want to search for. The following displays an unconfigured search standard object action.\n\nUnconfigured search standard object action. Select the category and specific object to search for.\nRegardless of category, we're able to search for any standard objects by its internal ID or its external ID. As these IDs are unique, we would only retrieve a maximum of 1 record if we search by IDs.\n\nAvailable categories to search from\nRegardless of category, we're able to search for any standard objects by its internal ID or its external ID. As these IDs are unique, we would only retrieve a maximum of 1 record if we search by IDs.\n\nAbility to search NetSuite record by unique internal ID or external ID\nDepending on the object category selected, we would be able to search by additional fields specific to that category.\nFor example, some of the available fields to search by for transaction categories is its status - opened or closed status, and its number.\n\nAvailable fields to search by for transaction category\nSome of the available fields to search by for relationship categories is its company name and email.\n\nAvailable fields to search by for relationship category\nWhen selecting the fields to search by in the NetSuite connector, take note that some NetSuite fields are displayed with their internal API names instead of their labels in NetSuite. For example, entity ID refers to the customer/vendor to attach a transaction document to, while internal ID refers to the NetSuite ID of any object.\nIf you can't find the field you're looking for, check with your NetSuite admin or with us!\nSearch custom objects action\nThe search custom objects action will return a list of records that match the criteria given. If no matching record is found, the action will simply return an empty array.\nConfiguring the search custom objects action\nTo carry out a search custom objects action, we would first need to tell the recipe exactly what specific custom object we want to search for. The following displays an unconfigured search custom objects action.\n\nUnconfigured search custom object action. Select the the specific object to search for.\nRegardless of selected object, we're able to search for any custom objects by its internal ID or its external ID. As these IDs are unique, we would only retrieve a maximum of 1 record if we search by IDs.\nDepending on the object selected, we would be able to search by additional fields specific to that object.\n\nAvailable fields to search by for the custom object estimate\nWhen selecting the fields to search by in the NetSuite connector, take note that some NetSuite fields are displayed with their internal API names instead of their labels in NetSuite. For example, entity ID refers to the customer/vendor to attach a transaction document to, while internal ID refers to the NetSuite ID of any object.\nIf you can't find the field you're looking for, check with your NetSuite admin or with us!\nUpdate standard object and update custom object action\nThe update standard object and update custom object actions are similar except that the former works with standard NetSuite objects, while the latter works with custom objects created by your organization.\nIn this section, we'll be covering how to use the update standard object action, which will be applicable for the update custom object action as well.\nFunctions of the update object actions\nThe following lists the various types of updates you can do with the update object action.\n\nOverwrite existing field values with new values (you can't delete an existing value of a field and change it to null/a blank value, however)\nAppend new lines to records (e.g. add additional line items to your sales order)\nReplace all lines in records (e.g. overwrite all existing line items in your sales order with a new set of line items)\n\nConfiguring your update action\n\nFirst, specify the object to update via internal ID or external ID\nTo update your NetSuite record, you first need to specify which record to update. You can use either the internal ID or the external ID to specify the record - all other fields with values passed into them will overwrite the original existing value in the NetSuite record.\n\n\nSpecifying the NetSuite record to update with either internal ID or external ID\n\nNext, configure the action to carry out the type of update you want: overwrite existing values or append values\n\nOverwrite existing field values\n\n\nTo do this, simply select the fields you wish to write to, then input the values or variables you wish to overwrite it with. For example, we might have a Shopify ecommerce site set up, and we want to move all our sales orders made in Shopify into NetSuite for inventory and delivery management.\nIn the following recipe, we're moving all newly created sales orders and all updates to existing orders from Shopify into NetSuite. Whenever there's a new/updated Shopify order, we try to search for the corresponding NetSuite order. If it exists, we'd update that NetSuite order. If it doesn't exist, we'll create a NetSuite order.\n\nRecipe that syncs Shopify sales orders into NetSuite.\nIn Step 3, which is the branch of the recipe we'd execute if we manage to find a NetSuite order that corresponds to the incoming Shopify sales order, we pass in the internal ID of the NetSuite order we've found.\n\nSpecify NetSuite record to update via internal ID\nIn this update action, we're taking the values of the note and email fields in the Shopify order, and updating the values of the memo and email fields in the corresponding NetSuite order.\n\nUpdate memo and email fields\nWhen selecting the fields to update in the NetSuite connector, take note that some NetSuite fields are displayed with their internal API names instead of their labels in NetSuite. For example, entity ID refers to the customer/vendor to attach a transaction document to, while internal ID refers to the NetSuite ID of any object.\nIf you can't find the field you're looking for, check with your NetSuite admin or with us!\n\nAppend new lines to object VS replacing all lines in the object\n\nThere are numerous NetSuite objects which contains one or more lists. For example, transaction objects such as sales orders have lists of line items. When updating objects in NetSuite, with most lists you have the ability to define whether you'd like to append more elements to the list, or if you'd like to replace the existing list with a whole new list.\nFirst specify the object you'd like to update, then the specific ID of the object to update. Do the same data mapping for the item list as you would usually do.\n\nSelect object and record ID to update\nAt the end of most NetSuite lists, you will see the Replace all option. Select True to overwrite all existing list items, select False to append new list items to existing list of items.\n\nReplace all picklist found at the end of NetSuite lists\nWhen selecting the fields to update in the NetSuite connector, take note that some NetSuite fields are displayed with their internal API names instead of their labels in NetSuite. For example, entity ID refers to the customer/vendor to attach a transaction document to, while internal ID refers to the NetSuite ID of any object.\nIf you can't find the field you're looking for, check with your NetSuite admin or with us!\n"},"connectors/oracle-ebs.html":{"url":"connectors/oracle-ebs.html","title":"Oracle EBS","keywords":"","body":"Oracle E-Business Suite\nOracle's E-Business Suite (also known as Applications/Apps or EB-Suite/EBS), is a collection of enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management (CRM), and supply-chain management (SCM) computer applications that enables organizations of any size to operate and perform effectively.\nHow to connect to Oracle E-Business Suite on Workato\nPre-requisites\n\nInstall Oracle E-Business Suite Integrated SOA Gateway\n\nInstall Workato on-prem agent\n\nIn the Oracle EBS, deploy User PL/SQL REST service (internal name: FND_USER_PKG) with name “user”.

The connector implements a messaging system with support for guaranteed and persistent delivery. This allows us to chain recipes sequentially, as a recipe can publish a message that multiple other recipes consume as a trigger to kickstart their workflow.\nThis connector allows us to add or modify recipes which are consumers without affecting recipes which are publishers. This enables zero downtime for the publisher recipe as we can add new consumers without impacting or requiring changes in the publisher recipe. This decoupling results in simpler recipes and reduces the time required to create, test, and maintain recipes.\nHow to connect to the PubSub connector on Workato\nThere is no connection required to use the PubSub connector, as schemas are stored in the Workato account for recipes to interact with.\nWorking with the PubSub connector\nIn order to work with the PubSub connector, users require access to the PubSub topics feature, which is enabled only for certain plans. Check the Pricing and Plans page or reach out to Workato sales representatives at +1 (844) 469-6752 to find out more.\nCreating and managing topics\nWhen using the PubSub connector, you can listen to messages in a topic or publish messages to a topic. In order to do so, you have to first create a topic, and define the message structure for that topic, so that publishers and consumers alike know what to expect when sending or receiving messages.\nYou can create and manage your topics on the topics feature page.\n\nManage and create topics on the topics page\nWhen creating topics, you will need to define what the data structure of the messages will look like.

After creating the lead, the recipe updates an analytics database in Postgres.\n\nRecipe moving leads from an online form to Salesforce and PostgreSQL\nIf our organization was to change databases from PostgreSQL to RedShift, and start using MailChimp as a mailing list application, we have 2 approaches we can take.\n1) Modify the original recipe without using the PubSub connector\nWe would need to update our recipe as follows.\n\nModified recipe to add rows to Redshift instead of PostgreSQL and add subscribers to MailChimp\nThe change to the original recipe would require additional iterations of the recipe development lifecycle, as the recipe would need to be modified, tested for backward compatibility, and pushed to production. Any bugs slipping through QA would result in downtime for the production recipe.\n2) Use the PubSub connector\nIf we were utilizing the PubSub connector and queues, we could have built the original recipe in this way, to create a Salesforce lead before publishing the lead data to a topic. This recipe will not need to care about its consumers, and therefore it does not need to know that downstream recipes are changing from PostgreSQL to Redshift, or that there is an additional consumer writing to MailChimp.\n\nPublisher recipe that creates a lead in Salesforce and publishes lead data to a topic\nThe corresponding consumer recipe that creates a Redshift row with the lead data will look as follows.\n\nConsumer recipe that consumes the lead data from the topic and creates a Redshift row with the lead data\nThe corresponding consumer recipe that creates a MailChimp lead with the lead data will look as follows.\n\nConsumer recipe that consumes the lead data from the topic and creates a MailChimp lead with the lead data\n"},"connectors/quickbooks.html":{"url":"connectors/quickbooks.html","title":"QuickBooks Online","keywords":"","body":"QuickBooks Online\nQuickBooks Online is an easy-to-use accounting software package that enables businesses to manage business payments, bills, and payroll functions.\nAPI version\nThe QuickBooks Online connector uses the V3 REST API.\nSupported editions and versions\nThe QuickBooks connector works with all versions of QuickBooks Online- QuickBooks Self-Employed, QuickBooks Simple Start, QuickBooks Essentials, as well as QuickBooks Plus.\nWorkato currently does not support QuickBooks Desktop/Enterprise versions.\nHow to connect to QuickBooks on Workato\nQuickBooks Online supports OAuth1.

Simply create new connections for each Company.\nHowever, if you have multiple Workato accounts and try to connect to the same Company, the earlier connection will be disconnected. Hence, we recommend that only 1 Workato account is used to connect to 1 Company to prevent any disruption to your recipes.\nQuickBooks triggers\nThe following triggers are currently available for the QuickBooks connector:\nNEW: Account, Bank Deposit, Bill Payment, Credit Note, Customer, Employee, Estimate, Invoice, Item, Payment, Sales Receipt, Vendor\nNEW/UPDATED: Account, Tax Code, Tax Rate\nUPDATED: Bill, Credit Note, Customer, Employee, Estimate, Invoice, Item, Purchase, Vendor\nIf you wish to submit a request for a new Trigger not currently available, please visit:\nAction: Add Line to Invoice\nSales Item Detail vs. Discount Line Detail vs. Description only\nSales Item Detail\nAs the name suggests, user is required to key in some of the details regarding the sales item.

The line items detail will be pulled dynamically from a list data pill. You can learn more about it here.\nWhen do I use 'Create with 1 line item'?\nCreating a single invoice with only line items are great for Single sync ups, where details of the transactional items are minimal. Example of this is creating an invoice for an opportunity, or creating a Sales Receipt for donations. Subsequently, adding on line items to an invoice can be done in another recipe when new items are added for an existing invoice, giving you the flexibility of structuring your invoices.\nIn all other cases, you should use 'Create with line items' and simply place the list of items where required.\n\nA 'list' type pill is marked with the list logo as can be seen above in red.\nBank Deposit\nWorkato has several QuickBooks actions that are related to a Bank Deposit object:\n\nCreate bank deposits\nSearch bank deposits\nUpdate bank deposits\n\nThe available fields for a Bank Deposits are:\n\nTxn Date\n\nDate of the transaction object\n\n\nTotal amount\n\nThe total amount that the bank deposit should amount to.

Simply use the Salesforce Secondary app on Workato, and you will be able to use both accounts in a single recipe. Find out more here.\nUsing real-time triggers\nWorkato offers real-time capabilities for 2 Salesforce triggers, namely New Object and New/Updated Object. This allows Workato to pick up any object that was created/updated in Salesforce immediately. To enable this, \n\nLog in to your Salesforce instance and click on 'Setup' at the top right of the page. \nOn the left hand panel, under Build, click on Create > Workflow & Approvals > Workflow rules. \nSelect the Object which you want to receive real time updates for and click Next.\nFill in the required and optional field:\nRule name,\nRule Criteria (Rule criteria can be set based on your preference. For example, only when Opportunity status equals “Closed Won\".)\nAfter you are done, click Save & Next.\n\nSelect New Outbound Message under Specify workflow actions and fill in the required and optional fields.\n\nYou are now set up for real-time integration! Simply go to your Workato recipe and choose real-time trigger. Note that you can only use these triggers with objects you have set up the above steps with. \n\nSalesforce real-time triggers is enabled only for certain plans. Check the Pricing and Plans page or reach out to Workato sales representatives at +1 (844) 469-6752 to find out more.\nWorking with generic triggers in Salesforce\nIn Workato, a Trigger refers to a condition that is set to start off a recipe. All the triggers on the Salesforce connector deals with Objects. The name of the trigger tells you exactly what event must occur for a recipe to take place. The term \"object\" is exactly the same as how it is used within Salesforce itself, and refers to things such as leads, opportunities, accounts, as well as custom objects you may have created for your organisation. Simply click on the Object field's dropdown list and you will be able to see all the objects associated with the instance of Salesforce you have connected to a recipe. For example, you use the trigger \"New Object\" and select Lead as the object. Your recipe will trigger every time a new lead is created. \nWorking with generic create/update/search actions in Salesforce\nWhen working with Salesforce Actions on Workato, you should find it extremely easy if you are familliar with the fields in the objects on your Salesforce account. When you select an object to use in a create/update/search action, you will see all the fields associated with that object appearing in your action. For example, if you were to choose Lead you will see fields like phone, email, lead status etc. Simply drag and drop pills into the associated fields you want to populate in a create/update action, or for the field you want to search with in the search action. \nWorking with attachments in Salesforce\nUploading\nTo upload an attachment to Salesforce using Workato, you can use the Create Object Action, and select Attachment under the Object field. Before that however, you need to have a step that downloads the file that is to be uploaded to Salesforce. You may use the Box action get file download URL, followed by using the utilities tool to upload it from the obtained URL, or a simillar flow of actions with another connector.  You can check out this example here on how to download a file to Workato.\nDownloading\nTo download an attachment from Salesforce, you can use the Download file Action.  The file ID must be obtained from a previous step, usually from the Get object details step. Once that step is properly set up, you will be able to use the attachment as a pill in the other steps of the recipe, for example, you can use the Upload file action in the Box connector. \nWorking with SOQL in Salesforce\nSalesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) is used to search your Salesforce data for specific information. SOQL syntax consists of a required SELECT statement which may be followed by a number of optional clauses (such as TYPEOF, WHERE, WITH, GROUP BY, etc.).\nIn a Workato recipe, the scheduled object query trigger will run SOQL queries with the following basic syntax: SELECT (list of fields) FROM (an object) WHERE (filter statements/sorting).\nThe recipe will automatically handle the SELECT FROM portion of your query. It will SELECT all fields FROM the object you choose from the pick list. For optional clauses, the trigger currently only supports WHERE conditions.\nFor a list of standard fields for major Salesforce objects, see: Salesforce Fields Reference.\nInputting SOQL WHERE Conditions (Syntax):\nThe WHERE clause follows field expression syntax. A fieldExpression is defined as follows: \\ \\ \\.\nComparison operators:\nComparison operators include the following: =, !=, , >=, LIKE, IN, NOT IN, INCLUDES, and EXCLUDES. Here is a simple example following fieldExpression syntax:\n\nFor detailed information on how to use each comparison operator, see: Comparison Operators.\nLogical operators:\nMultiple field expressions can be joined using logical operators. These include: AND, OR, and NOT. The basic syntax is as follows:\n\nfieldExpressionX AND fieldExpressionY\nfieldExpressionX OR fieldExpressionY\nNOT fieldExpressionX.\n\nHere is an example showing two fieldExpressions joined by a logical operator:\n\nFor more information on logical operators, see: Logical Operators.\nDate Formats and Date Literals:\nTo filter on date fields in a query, you must use Date only format. The syntax for this is: YYYY-MM-DD.\nTo filter on dateTime fields in a query, you must use the format including: date, time, and time zone offset. There are three possible syntax formats for this:\n\nYYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss+hh:mm\nYYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss-hh:mm\nYYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ.\n\nIn order to query a date or dateTime field, you may need to turn on formula mode if you are not using it already. This is needed to convert your timestamp to the ISO8601 format expected in SOQL. Also note that you do not need to use single quotes around date or dateTime values.\nFor date fields, add ‘.to_date’ to the end of your date formula to convert your date or timestamp to the correct format.\n\n\nFor dateTime fields, the third syntax format is the simplest to use. After entering the formula to get your desired timestamp (eg: now, 2.weeks.ago.beginning_of_day, etc.), add ‘.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z\")’ to the end of it.\n\nFor more information on date formats and date literals, see: Date Formats and Date Literals\nFor additional help, see Salesforce documentation\n\nSOQL\nWHERE Clause Syntax\n\nPrevent schema errors with Fields list\nWhen using a Salesforce trigger/action in a recipe, all object fields (standard and custom fields) are requested from Salesforce by default, even if these fields are not used in the recipe.\nIf a Salesforce admin changes the Salesforce object schema, e.g. deletes fields in the object, the recipe throws an error when making API requests to Salesforce for that object. This is because these deleted fields are still being requested from Salesforce by the recipe, which is an invalid request. On the other hand, if fields are added to the Salesforce object, there will not be any recipe errors as Workato will simply not request for these additional fields.\nSuch schema differences between Salesforce and Workato can be resolved by a schema refresh. However, if frequent schema changes are expected, we can utilize the Fields input field to control the fields that we request from Salesforce. This will ensure that schema changes unrelated to the recipe will not cause the recipe to break or experience errors.\nFields list\nThe Fields list input field allows users to select the fields they wish to use in the recipe. This ensures that the recipe will be affected only by changes to these subset of fields, and therefore minimize impact on the recipe due to schema changes.\nThe benefits of using the Fields list are:\n\nImproved recipe performance\nImproved recipe usability due to smaller datatree with only relevant datapills\nMinimizes impact on recipe by Salesforce object schema changes\n\nHow to use Fields list\nSalesforce triggers and actions have an optional input field called Fields. This is a multiselect field for you to select the data fields you want to use in the recipe. If left blank, the Salesforce trigger/action will retrieve all data fields in the datatree by default.\n\nUnconfigured fields selector. All account data fields are retrieved in the datatree by default.\nAll data fields of your selected object will be available in the Fields list.\n\nFields selector displays all available data fields for your selected object by default\nBy selecting any subset of these fields, the datatree will be regenerated to display only the selected datapills.\n\nConfiguring the fields selector - the datatree is regenerated when any fields are selected\nIn Salesforce, you can choose to retrieve related objects' data as well, e.g. if your trigger is a new opportunity in Salesforce, we can retrieve data about the Salesforce account the opportunity is related to. If your trigger is a new case, we can retrieve data about the Salesforce contact, lead or account the opportunity is related to. To tell Workato the fields to select, first select the related objects you're interested in, then select the fields of this related obect you're interested in.\nIn the following example, we first selected account as the primary base object, then parent account as the join object. The Fields multiselect list is promptly populated with fields belonging to the parent account as well. Similarly, if the Fields list is not configured, all account and parent accountfields will be fetched from Salesforce.\n\nAvailable join object fields will be shown when the related join objects is selected\nAll data fields of your selected base and related join objects will be available in the Fields list. By selecting any subset of these fields, the datatree will be regenerated to display only the selected datapills.\n\nConfiguring the fields selector containing base and related join object data fields - the datatree is regenerated when any fields are selected\nBy limiting the datatree to only the fields we're interested in using, we mitigate the effects of Salesforce schema changes on our recipe.\nBest practices\nWhen starting to use Workato with your Salesforce account, we reccomend that you either do it on a sandbox account, or test on non-essential pieces of data. This would prevent any loss of crucial data, especially since actions performed through Workato cannot be undone.\nWorking with sandboxes on Workato\nSalesforce sandboxes are isolated from your Salesforce production organization, so operations that you perform in your sandboxes don’t affect your Salesforce production organization, and conversely. Sandboxes are nearly identical to your Salesforce production organization. For a list of differences, see Sandbox Setup Tips and Considerations.\nTroubleshooting\nHere is a list of common errors that you may encounter, and links to how to rectify them.\n\n400 Bad Request\nerrorCode: MALFORMED_ID.

Example recipe\nUsing Slack message buttons\nYou can interact with messages in Slack via Slack buttons. To use Slack buttons in Slack, you need:\n1) A recipe with a Post mesage action that has buttons configured. This recipe needs to specifically refer to the second recipe below in its button configuration.\n2) A button action handler recipe - a recipe with a New button action trigger, which picks up button clicks. In the actions, there should be recipe logic that carries out actions depending on which button has been clicked.\nThere are 2 ways we can build interactive Slack buttons recipes, either via IF conditions, or via the Slack action Respond to button.\nUsing IF conditions to build interactive Slack buttons recipes\nPossible use cases for building your recipe via IF conditional recipe steps would be scenarios whereby you're okay with multiple clicks of the buttons, such as team polls.\nExample recipe #1A: recipe with a post message action with buttons configured\nWe're going to add buttons configuration to the basic recipe we had above. The recipe we will be using can be found here.\nThe buttons configured in this recipe show up in Slack as follows.\n\nCorresponding buttons generated from the above configuration\nButton styles: danger and non-danger\nThere are two available styles for buttons - non-danger and danger style. The non-danger styled buttons, once clicked, records the button click immediately and triggers the second recipe with the New button action trigger.\n\nInteracting with non-danger styled button\nThe danger styled buttons, when clicked, generates a popup prompt that asks the Slack user for confirmation of their click.\n\nInteracting with danger styled button\nThe prompt that pops up can be completely configured in the button configuration in the Slack action Post message.\n\nPopup prompt\nButton definitions\nThe button configuration for both button styles is in the following screenshot. We're calling a recipe we have pre-built: New Salesforce account button response recipe - Notify BizDev & Notify Sales. All recipes with the Slack trigger New button action should show up in this picklist - select the recipe you have built to respond to this particular set of buttons.\n\nButton configuration for post message action step\nThe following is the button configuration we used in the recipe. For non-danger styled actions, only the first 2 parameters need to be filled in, as there is no popup prompt generated. For danger styled actions, all 7 parameters need to be filled in.\nNotify BizDev, bd, , , , ,\nNotify Sales, sales, danger, Confirm, Are you sure?, Yes, Cancel\nThe above button configuration follows this format for button actions:\naction name, action ID, style, confirmation title, confirmation text, ok button title, dismiss button title\nThe following is an elaboration on each field in the definition of a button.\n\n\n\nButton definition input fields\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nAction name\nButton label visible to Slack user interacting with the buttons.\n\n\nAction ID\nInternal value of the button. This needs to be unique. Not visible on Slack to anyone.\n\n\nStyle\nEITHER: leave blank for a simple button. Leave the following fields blank as well. OR: put danger for a red button with a popup prompt requiring the user to confirm the button click. Fill in the following fields too.\n\n\nConfirmation title\nShows up in the popup prompt as the header.\n\n\nConfirmation text\nShows up in the popup prompt as the body text.\n\n\nOk button title\nButton label in the popup prompt to confirm the button click.\n\n\nDismiss button title\nButton label in the popup prompt to cancel the button click.\n\n\n\nExample recipe #1B: button action handler recipe - recipe with a new button action trigger with IF conditional logic defining the actions to carry out upon each button click\nThis following recipe has been built for the above scenario. It posts different messages as a thread under the first Salesforce account notification message, depending on which button has been clicked. Using IF conditions is more versatile than using the Slack action Respond to button, because you can carry out multiple steps in the IF condition and in multiple apps.\nIn this recipe, to check which button has been clicked, we use the IF condition to check the button name. If it matches \"Notify BizDev\", we post a message for the business development team, and if it matches \"Notify Sales\", we post a message for the sales team.\n\nButton response using IF conditions. Example recipe\nOutput of the Slack trigger - new button action\nThe datapills used in the IF conditions come from the Slack trigger New button action. The following screenshot shows the output datatree from the Slack trigger New button action. The datapills are variables that the recipe builder can use while building the recipe actions.\n\nOutput datatree of the new button trigger\nThe following table elaborates upon these datapill variables and what they can be used for.\n\n\n\nNew button click trigger output datapills\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nAction name\nButton label visible to Slack user interacting with the buttons.\n\n\nAction ID\nInternal value of the button. This needs to be unique. Not visible on Slack to anyone.\n\n\nChannel\nThe channel where the button click occurred. You can obtain both the channel internal Slack ID and the channel name.\n\n\nUser\nThe user who clicked the button. You can obtain both the user internal Slack ID and the username.\n\n\nTeam\nThe Slack team where the button click occurred. You can obtain both the unique domain and the internal team ID.\n\n\nAction timestamp\nThe epoch time when the button click occurred.\n\n\nMessage ID\nThe epoch time when the message with buttons was sent. Can be used to populate Thread ID input fields to create a thread under this message.\n\n\nAttachment ID\nID of the attachment sent with the initial Slack message with buttons, if any.\n\n\nResponse URL\nUsed by Workato to respond to the button click. Also used in Slack action Respond to button.\n\n\n\nAn example of the values can be viewed in the job output, as follows.\n\nButton action data output\nUsing Slack respond to button action to build interactive Slack buttons recipes\nPossible use cases for building your recipe in this way would be scenarios whereby you only wish the button to be clicked once, such as approval workflows, e.g. approving leave, approving expenses.\nExample recipe #2A: recipe with 2 post message actions with buttons configured\nWe're going to use almost exactly the same recipe as example recipe #1A, except that we're breaking up the single Slack action Post message into 2 separate Post message actions. The first action will post notification information (in this case, my Salesforce account information), while the second action will only post button data. The recipe we will be using can be found here.\nThe buttons configured in this recipe show up in Slack as follows.\n\nSalesforce account information and button posted via separate actions\nWhen the button is clicked on, it is immediately replaced by a message notifying either the business development or the sales team.\n\nThis is because the input field Replace original? has been marked as true in the Respond to button action configuration. We will cover this action in the following section. This allows us to remove the buttons from the Slack channel once they have been clicked on - so as to prevent multiple clicks on the buttons. This is also why the first recipe breaks up the notification information and the buttons data into 2 separate actions - we want to replace only the buttons with the new message, and not replace the notification information.\nExample recipe #2B: button action handler recipe - recipe with a new button action trigger with Slack action Respond to button that responds to each button click with a Slack message\nThis following recipe is an alternative way we can build the interactive scenario on Slack. Similarly, it posts different messages back in the channel depending on which button has been clicked. We use the Slack action Respond to button to immediately post a message back onto the channel.\n\nRespond to button action. Example recipe\nWith the Respond to button action, we can simply pass in the button response URL, and the recipe will know, at run-time, which button has been clicked. Therefore, if we wish to do something like post a generic message that tells the channel which button has been clicked, this action is suited to handle that easily.\n\nRespond to button action configuration\nInput of the Slack action - respond to button action\nThe following are the new input fields that the Slack action Respond to button introduces to the usual input fields in the Post message action.\n\n\n\nRespond to button action input field\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nButton response URL\nProvide this from the output datatree of the Slack trigger New button action. This tells the action what button click to respond to.\n\n\nResponse type\nIn channel will post the message like a normal chat message. Ephemeral will post the message in greyed out text.\n\n\nReplace original\nIf yes, the new message will overwrite the original message with buttons and be posted in the same position in the channel. If no, the original message with buttons will remain in the same position in the channel. The new message will be added to the end of the channel conversation.\n\n\nDelete original\nIf yes, the original message with buttons will be removed from the channel. The new The new message will be added to the end of the channel conversation. If no, the original message with buttons will remain in the same position in the channel. The new message will be added to the end of the channel conversation.\n\n\n\nUsing Slack threads\nSlack threads allow you to group related messages together, making it easier to follow conversations in Slack channels or groups. To use Slack threads, you can either:\n1) continue a conversation by replying to a message ID and starting a thread,\n2) continue a conversation by replying to the parent message ID (the very first message of the thread), or\n3) continue an existing thread by replying to the thread ID.\nYou need to specify the message ID, parent message ID or thread ID in the Thread ID input field in order to start or continue a thread.\nExample recipe #1: recipe that replies to a message ID and starts a thread\nLet us relook at the above example recipe that responds to a button click.\n\nButton response example recipe\nIf a Slack user clicks on the Notify BizDev button, we can see that it creates a new thread by posting under the original message,\n\nThread created and message posted if Slack user clicks on the Notify BizDev button\nThe configuration in the recipe is as follows. We're passing the message ID of the original Slack message into the Thread ID input field. As the message has no thread currently, it will create a new thread.\n\nAction configuration for the Notify BizDev action. Message ID is used in the Thread ID input field.\nCorrespondingly, if a Slack user clicks on the Notify Sales button, we can see that it creates a new thread by posting under the original message.\n\nThread created and message posted if Slack user clicks on the Notify Sales button\nThe configuration in the recipe is as follows. We're passing the message ID of the original Slack message into the Thread ID input field. As the message has no thread currently, it will create a new thread.\n\nAction configuration for the Notify Sales action. Message ID is used in the Thread ID input field.\nExample recipe #2: recipe that replies to a parent message ID and continues a thread\nUsing the same recipe as above, we can see that putting the parent message ID also works to post to an existing thread.\n\nButton response example recipe\nFor example, when I click on the Notify BizDev button for the second time, it posts to the same thread.\n\nMessages are posted under the same thread via parent message ID\nReferring back to the action's thread configuration, we see that we're specifying the parent message ID in the Thread ID input field, which is the initial message that the thread is under.\n\nAction configuration for the Notify BizDev action. Message ID is used in the Thread ID input field.\n"},"connectors/surveymonkey.html":{"url":"connectors/surveymonkey.html","title":"SurveyMonkey","keywords":"","body":"SurveyMonkey\nSurveyMonkey is a widely used online forms and survey software that allows users to easily design and send surveys and forms, as well as analyze the results.\nAPI version\nThe SurveyMonkey connector uses SurveyMonkey REST API V3.\nSupported editions and versions\nThe SurveyMonkey connector works with all SurveyMonkey plans.

Refer to documentation about configuring the advanced scheduler trigger here.\n\nScheduled report input\nOutputs\nThis trigger returns a number of fields:\n\nScheduled time\nTotal number of records\nStarting offset\nEnding offset\nFirst batch\nLast batch\nRows\n\nScheduled time\nThis datapill tells you the time that the report was ran.\nTotal number of records\nThis datapill tells you the total number of rows generated in the scheduled run of the report. If this report has more than 200 rows, they will be split into batches of 200 rows per batch. Each batch will then be processed as individual jobs, in the same sequence as returned by the Workday RaaS endpoint.\nStarting offset/ending offset\nThese 2 datapills are used to indicate the number of rows offset for this batch. For example, if there are a total of 1000 rows and the current job is on the 2th batch (rows 201 to 500), the Starting offset will be 200 and ending offset will be 499.\nFirst batch/last batch\nThese 2 datapills are boolean fields which indicate whether the batch is the first/last batch. This is useful in scenarios where you want to create a file from the output of a Workday report. Your recipe will contain the following logic:\nif First batch is true\n   create a new file with contents of the first batch\nif First batch is false\n   append lines to an existing file\nif Last batch is true\n   Send notification about successful transfer of report content\nRows\nEach batch of rows is returned as a list (array). Each item in this list corresponds to a row in the report. Similarly, each column in your report will be rendered as a field in the output datatree.\n\nScheduled report output\n"},"connectors/workday/workday_raas.html":{"url":"connectors/workday/workday_raas.html","title":"Report-as-a-Service","keywords":"","body":"Workday RaaS\nWorkday Report-as-a-Service (RaaS) is a feature that exposes reports as web services.

You can create a new connector as well as add new triggers or actions to existing Workato connectors.\nThere are 2 types of HTTP connectors:\n\nStandard auth and variations\nOAuth 2\n\nDifference between HTTP and HTTP (OAuth2) connector\nApart from the authentication flow for the connection, the functionalities of both connectors are the same. The process of configuring webhook triggers, polling triggers and REST actions are identical.\nFor non-OAuth2 connections, an additional test API request is required to ascertain that the connection is valid.\nWhat is the HTTP connector and what is it useful for?\nOur generic HTTP and HTTP (OAUTH2) connector allows you to chat with all (well, almost!) cloud applications with an application program interface (API for short). This means that, outside of the Workato-built connectors that comes out of the box, you can build whatever triggers or actions you need to power your integration recipes. \nWith the HTTP connector, it takes less than 20 minutes to build your own trigger or action on Workato. This course will walk you through:\n\nHow to set up a connection (Oauth2 and non OAuth2) to your app\n\nHow to build your own Workato triggers to get notified when something happens in your apps\n\nHow to build your own Workato actions to execute certain steps in your apps automatically\n\n\nWant to create an invoice in your accounting system? Make a POST request with a JSON request body. Want to retrieve metrics from your analytics application? Make a GET request with your query parameters. Want to trigger off upon new leads filling out your online form? Create a webhook trigger that notifies Workato immediately whenever a new lead completes your form. Want help getting started? Simply read on, or chat with one of our Customer Success superheros :)\nSet up your OAuth2 connection\nThe HTTP (OAuth2) connector supports the authorization code grant variant of the OAuth2 standard, which is the current de facto authentication standard adopted by a number of cloud apps. It’s widely adopted because it allows you to give third parties access to your apps without having to disclose your username and password to the third party. In this case, Workato simply redirects you to your app, where you key in your login credentials, and that’s sufficient for the app to trust that Workato is acting on your behalf when it makes API requests.\n\nHTTP (OAuth2) connector's connection fields\nRelevant components of OAuth2 connection\nAuthorization URL\nURL that Workato redirects you to when you click on the ‘Connect’ button. This usually brings you to the login screen of your app.\nSome APIs require that you include certain parameters in the authorization URL. Common examples are response_type (code or token) and scope (read, write, admin, etc).\nThis should be publicly available from the API documentation of the app you’re connecting to, under the Authentication section.\nToken URL\nURL that Workato will retrieve an auth token from. This auth token is used to verify that we have permission to access your app and its data.\nThis should be publicly available from the API documentation of the app you’re connecting to, under the Authentication section.\nClient ID and client secret\nThe client ID identifies you as the user who’s sending these API calls, while the client secret authenticates that you as this user.\nThis is usually found in the Settings or Integrations page (or equivalent) of your logged in app account that you wish to connect to. This is specific to your account and should be kept secret.\nCredentials\nA set of username and password for logging into your app to give permission for Workato to access the data in the app.\nThis user (to whom the credentials belong) should have the correct permissions to read/write to the records (e.g. customer records, sales invoice records) you want to access.\nRedirect/callback URL (to be configured in the app)\nThe URL provided to the app for redirection back to Workato after going through the authentication flow and credentials/token exchange.\nProvide this URL https://www.workato.com/oauth/callback to the app if it asks for it in the Integration setup screen.\nExample - connecting to Eventbrite via OAuth2\nLet us run through an example of how we can connect to an OAuth2 application. In this case, we’ll use Eventbrite, an events management and ticketing application. \n\nEventbrite OAuth2 authentication page\nFrom the documentation page, we can obtain 2 of the required fields for our connection - the authorize URL and the access token URL. We would need to append further parameters to the URL. Eventbrite's documentation mentions that we'd need to post to this URL: https://www.eventbrite.com/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_KEY\nBut as Workato will handle the client key, the following is what's needed in the input field to connect.\nEventbrite authorize URL:\nhttps://www.eventbrite.com/oauth/authorize?response_type=code\n\nEventbrite access token URL:\nhttps://www.eventbrite.com/oauth/token\n\nIn order to connect to your Eventbrite account successfully, you would also need a set of client ID and client secret. To obtain this, you will need to register an app with Eventbrite so that they can assign the app with a client ID and secret. Log into Eventbrite and navigate to Account Settings > App Management. \n\nEventbrite's app management screen\nIn the app management page, you will be able to find your client ID (also called key). Expand the Show Client Secret and OAuth Token section to retrieve the client secret, and navigate to the App Extension section to input the callback URL https://www.workato.com/oauth/callback into Eventbrite.\n\nCompleted Eventbrite connection\nSet up your non-OAuth2 connection\nEstablishing a non-OAuth2 connection is slightly more complex than establishing an OAuth2 connection - you would have to select the authentication type specific to the application you're attempting to integrate with. In this segment, we’ll be going through the various options available.\nNone\nThis allows you to create a connection without providing any authentication details. This is usually the case when you wish to just receive a webhook trigger from the app. Workato generates a URL for you to direct your webhooks to, and retrieves information from the webhook payload sent in.\n\nHTTP connector authentication type: None\nBasic\nThis requires your username and password. An alternative to your username and password would be an API key or API token, retrieved from your account settings. This is encoded with Base64 in transit, over SSL. This is a common authentication flow.\n\nHTTP connector authentication type: Basic\nHeader Auth\nFor applications which require additional headers outside of the usual username and password or API key, or if you want to customize the headers sent in the request. Header authentication can be used when you have a generated token ready for use.\n\nHTTP connector authentication type: Header authorization\nQuery params\nFor applications where the authentication structure is based on validating an API key as a parameter. What you need to do is to add the parameter key/value pair in the params authorization field.\n\nHTTP connector authentication type: Query params\nCustom\nCustom simply allows you to use a combination of any of the above fields.\n\nHTTP connector authentication type: Custom\nTesting your non-OAuth2 connection\nAfter you've connected, you would need to test out your non-OAuth2 connection to ensure that it's valid. To do that, send out a test API request - a simple one would be a GET request. If it succeeds, you know that the connection is valid.\nExample - connecting to JIRA via basic authentication and testing the connection via a GET action\nLet’s try to connect to JIRA using basic authentication - JIRA’s documentation for basic authentication can be found here. In the case of JIRA, we need to provide several things: subdomain (which tells us what JIRA company instance to connect to, essentially - your company’s JIRA database), username, password.\nFor this example, I’ve created a company instance in JIRA with a company name Workato321, and JIRA has automatically assigned my subdomain to be workato321.atlassian.net\nI’ve also created a project in my new JIRA instance, named PPP, to be used for testing out my connection later.\nSetting up your JIRA connection\n\nJIRA screenshot with subdomain workato321.atlassian.net and existing project PPP\nWe can provide our username and password in the connection settings as below. For the field On-prem secure agent, I selected no gateway as my JIRA instance is on the cloud.\n\nJIRA connection settings\nTesting our JIRA connection by running a GET action\nWe're not done yet! Let's test out our connection. In the case of JIRA, the instance (subdomain) information needs to be sent in within the API endpoint, therefore it doesn’t need to be provided in your connection settings.\nTo test out my connection, I’m just going to ask Workato to fetch me all the projects in my JIRA instance with this GET all projects endpoint: https://workato321.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/project.\nThis is how my test recipe looks - it has a Scheduler trigger (New scheduled event, so that a job will be ran immediately when I click on run recipe, and it simply calls the API endpoint. We didn’t fill in the sample response body as this is simply a quick test - we’re not really interested in building the datatree for use in subsequent steps yet.\n\nConfigured HTTP action to get list of JIRA projects\nNow let’s run the recipe and click on the job that’s carried out. You should be able to see what’s been sent by the HTTP connector under the input tab.\n\nAPI request sent, as viewed from the job details input tab\nAnd if the API endpoint as well as username and password is correct, you should be able to see the data that’s returned under the output tab - in this case, my PPP project.\n\nAPI response received from JIRA, as viewed from the job details output tab\nBuilding webhook triggers\nIf the app you wish to integrate with supports webhooks, that should be listed in the app’s API documentation. Webhooks are notifications sent out immediately by your app to a target URL when an event happens. Usually, you’re able to define what specific event you wish to receive notifications for. To build a webhook trigger in Workato, we’ll direct these notifications to your Workato recipe, so that it will trigger and execute the recipe actions whenever the event happens in your app.\nFor example, you can choose to build a webhook trigger that notifies your recipe whenever new customer tickets are marked with status ‘Urgent’, and have an action to send out an SMS to the account manager for this customer. In this case, the recipe will help to ensure urgent tickets are responded to in a timely fashion.\nIf you’re interested only in receiving webhooks from your app, you won’t even need to set up any connection or go through the authentication flow.\nThese are the input fields in Workato's webhook trigger. Let's run through the key fields to note when building a webhook trigger.\n\nHTTP connector's webhook trigger\nWorkato-generated target URL\nURL address to direct your app-generated webhooks. The string of 36 characters generated in this URL is unique to your account, so keep it safe - otherwise anyone else on the internet can send you random data!\nBy default, this URL is incomplete. Provide an event name in order to generate a full URL to be used as a target URL.\nEvent name\nUsed to describe what you’re doing in this trigger. Put a descriptive name here so that you remember what is the specific event you’re receiving notifications for.\nThe event name will also be appended to the end of the Workato-generated URL in order to generate an URL which is unique to this recipe. \nWebhook type\nTell the recipe what is the type of webhook to expect, as well as the format of the data coming in, so that it knows how to decipher and process the payload. This depends on the specifications provided in the API documentation.\nSome APIs may be able to send you webhook payloads in various formats - in that case, select the one you’re more comfortable with, and make sure to provide the payload in the correct format in the Webhook payload example input field.\nWebhook payload example\nProvide a sample of the webhook payload that’s expected to be sent by your app to Workato. Typically found in the API documentation - simply copy and paste it in the appropriate JSON, XML or form encoded format as you've defined previously. You can also add additional fields to this, in the correct format, if you know that there are custom values that will be sent by your app.\nThis payload example provided does not affect the actual payload being sent to Workato when a trigger event occurs. Instead, this sample schema is used to build the output datatree and its data pills, thus ensuring that you’re able to map the data coming in with your webhook properly to subsequent steps in your datatree.\n\nExample of a configured webhook trigger\n\nThe trigger data schema corresponds to the webhook payload example provided in configuration\nExample - building a new order trigger in Eventbrite\nPerhaps we would like to build a real-time webhook trigger that triggers whenever a new order is placed in Eventbrite for your event “Christmas Marathon”. Let’s check out Eventbrite’s webhook\nSetting up the Workato HTTP trigger\nWe need to first get an URL from Workato to send our webhooks to. To do that, let’s start creating a webhook trigger on Workato. I've filled in the event name I want to create a complete target URL, and I've selected a PUT/POST with JSON payload as I know that's the format for Eventbrite webhooks.\nI've entered an empty JSON schema into the webhook payload example as I'm not too sure what my payload looks like yet.\n\nConfiguring webhook trigger with the event name and empty payload example\nSetting up the Eventbrite webhook\nIn Eventbrite, navigate to Account Settings > Webhooks to add a webhook. Input the payload URL obtained from Workato, and select the event you wish to monitor (‘All events’ is also available as an option). You can see that you’re able to select a variety of events to listen to and trigger upon, but in this case we just want to monitor new order for our Christmas Marathon event.\n\nCreating webhook to monitor new orders placed in Eventbrite\nYou can send in a test order to test the trigger, either via the webhook configuration page, or by creating an order on the event you’re monitoring. If you’ve set up the webhook trigger successfully, you should receive a job.\nIn this case, I've successfully ran a test job, and I can view the webhook payload by going to the trigger output tab in my job details page.\n\nJob details output tab showing the actual JSON response from Eventbrite\nTesting the trigger & retrieving API response to generate datatree\nWe're almost done with our webhook, but we still need to be able to generate a datatree for use in subsequent steps in our recipe. With the empty payload we had entered above, there's no trigger datatree available in subsequent recipe steps.\n\nWith an empty webhook payload example, no datatree is generated in the action steps\nWe can move the JSON response we obtained in the job history details to the payload example section with some tweaking to ensure it's formatted in JSON. Alternatively, we can also simply retrieve the JSON from the API documentation, if available.\n\nRequest payload can be retrieved via the webhook management console in Eventbrite\nThe following is the JSON response that we should be inputting into the webhook payload example field.\nJSON formatted webhook payload example:\n{\n\"config\": {\n\"action\":\"order.placed\",\n\"user_id\":\"144138753572\",\n\"endpoint_url\":\"https://www.workato.com/webhooks/rest/4c364864-e1f8-4c58-b6af-29127d1f6b60/order\",\n\"webhook_id\":\"287968\"\n},\n\"api_url\":\"https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/orders/579759447/\"\n}\n\nCompleted webhook trigger\nThat’s it! You have now created an Eventbrite webhook trigger for yourself. Take note that this trigger only passes you the API URL to fetch the actual data of the order that has been placed. To fetch this data, you can create a quick REST action to GET an order with this API URL, which we will be covering later in this course.\n\nConfigured webhook trigger\nWe can see the datatree of this webhook trigger, which is generated by the sample webhook payload provided in the trigger configuration.\n\nWebhook datatree\nBuilding your REST request action\nYou’re able to build any actions supported by an API on the HTTP connector - for example, create, update, search, get, delete actions. The following screenshots show the input fields available in the HTTP REST request action. Let's run through the key fields to note when building your action.\n\n\nInput fields for REST actions\nRequest name\nThis is used to describe what you’re doing in this action. Put a descriptive name here so that you remember what this action will execute.\nMethod\nThe specific HTTP method to call. The API documents will typically tell you what is the HTTP method associated with the API endpoint you want to call.\nRequest URL\nThe API endpoint to send your request to.\nRequest body\nThe data to send in with the request, in JSON format. This is typically only required for create and update actions (PUT, POST or PATCH methods), as you would need to provide the data of the record to be created or updated.\nResponse type\nThis specifies the format of the expected API response. If we’re not interested in converting the response into a datatree for subsequent use downstream in the recipe, simply select the option “Raw HTTP response body”. Otherwise, select JSON or XML accordingly.\nResponse body example\nThis will be converted into a datatree for subsequent use in the recipe. If you have selected “Parse response as JSON” above, you should input the expected schema in JSON format. If you have selected “Parse response as XML”, you should input the expected schema in XML format.\nExample - building a get order details action in Eventbrite\nFollowing from the Eventbrite new order webhook trigger we've previously configured, we now have a API endpoint to get order details for a specific order that has just been placed.\nSetting up the HTTP action\nThe relevant input fields for this action would only be the following. We can pass the API URL pill into the request URL input field to make the call to get the specific order details. We can leave the response body example empty for now, which means that no datatree will be generated for this step as of yet.\n\nPartially configured GET request missing the optional response body example for generating the datatree\nTesting the action\nIf you hadn't previously set up the trigger, you can simply pass a hardcoded URL into the request URL, replacing the specific order ID 579759447 with the ID of an Eventbrite order that exists in your Eventbrite account.\nEventbrite's GET order details API call:\nhttps://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/orders/579759447/\n\nAlternatively, if you had previously configured the webhook trigger and ran a couple of sample jobs, you can simply rerun a job again. As the trigger data is cached in Workato, rerunning the job will simply reuse the payload data that had been received in the trigger and execute this GET action.\n\nThe API URL from the trigger is passed to the action as the request URL\nRetrieving API response to generate datatree\nLook in the job history and you should be able to view the response. The text in the body is formatted precisely in JSON, so if you like you can simply copy that and put it into the Response body example input field (without the first and last double quotes).\n\nAPI response for Eventbrite's GET order API call, as viewed in the job history output tab\nAPI response for Eventbrite's GET order API call:\n{\"costs\": {\"base_price\": {\"display\": \"$0.00\", \"currency\": \"USD\", \"value\": 0, \"major_value\": \"0.00\"}, \"eventbrite_fee\": {\"display\": \"$0.00\", \"currency\": \"USD\", \"value\": 0, \"major_value\": \"0.00\"}, \"gross\": {\"display\": \"$0.00\", \"currency\": \"USD\", \"value\": 0, \"major_value\": \"0.00\"}, \"payment_fee\": {\"display\": \"$0.00\", \"currency\": \"USD\", \"value\": 0, \"major_value\": \"0.00\"}, \"tax\": {\"display\": \"$0.00\", \"currency\": \"USD\", \"value\": 0, \"major_value\": \"0.00\"}}, \"resource_uri\": \"https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/orders/579759447/\", \"id\": \"579759447\", \"changed\": \"2016-12-16T00:40:47Z\", \"created\": \"2016-12-16T00:40:46Z\", \"name\": \"hl y\", \"first_name\": \"hl\", \"last_name\": \"y\", \"email\": \"huilin@workato.com\", \"status\": \"placed\", \"time_remaining\": null, \"event_id\": \"30343163218\"}\n\nCompleted action\nThis is what your action should look like in the end:\n\nConfigured GET action\n\nConfigured GET action\n\nStep 1 output data tree generated from the provided response body example\nExample - building a create project action in JIRA\nLet's create a new project in JIRA via the HTTP connector.

You may also want to look out for the ability to query based on created/updated time which will be crucial when building out your triggers.\nCustom connector sharing\nThere are 3 modes of using a custom SDK based connector\n\nPrivate connector\nShared connector \nPublic connector\n\nBuild a private custom connector\nWhen you create a custom connector on the SDK, it is visible and available only in your account by default, i.e. it is private. You will be the only one who can use the triggers and actions of this custom connector when building recipes.\nIf someone else tries to install a copy of your recipe in their account to use it, they will be notified that this recipe utilizes a custom connector that they don't have access to.\nShare your custom connector\nCustom connectors can be shared with other Workato accounts. As owner of the custom connector, you can allow specific Workato accounts to view and install the connector in their own account for use.\nSharing is achieved by copying. Each Workato account you share the connector with will have the ability to make a copy of your custom connector code at that point in time. Subsequently, these Workato accounts can make modifications on their copy of the custom connector.\nInstall someone else's connector\nWhen users try to copy a recipe that uses a custom connector, they will be asked if they wish to request a share link for the custom connector. If they request for it, as the custom connector owner, you will be notified via email, and you can choose to share this link with them. Workato will send the requester a share link. The requester can click through this link to install the connector in their account. \nThis creates a copy of the connector in their account.\nUpgrade your copied connector to the latest available version\nWhen the custom connector owner makes a change to the custom connector code, all Workato accounts with a copy of this custom connector will see an upgrade link. They can choose to upgrade their installed connector by clicking the link.\nThe upgrade function will overwrite the copy of the custom connector code with the latest version of the master copy of the custom connector. This means that any changes to the custom connector code made by the requester will be overwritten. Do take note that this upgrade link appears whenever there is any change to the master copy of the custom connector, not necessarily when the custom connector owner has made a curated change.\nPublic connector\nTo enable global scope for your private connector, and make it such that all Workato users will be able to view and use your custo connector, you have to submit your code to Workato for review. Our team will approve or request for modifications within a few days.\nYou can begin this process by submitting a pull request to our custom connectors repository.\n"},"developing-connectors/sdk/walk-through.html":{"url":"developing-connectors/sdk/walk-through.html","title":"Walk through","keywords":"","body":"Connector SDK Basics\nThis chapter provides a step-by-step walk through of building your own custom connector. Less common features are not included here. For details and examples, navigate to the respective chapters.\nMaking requests\nThe custom connector framework supports building connectors to applications that offer an API reachable over HTTP/HTTPS.  The common request/response formats are supported: JSON (default), XML, and www-form-urlencoded.\nIn parts of the connector that need to make requests, the HTTP verbs (GET, POST etc) are supported as ruby methods.  Let's use an example of an API that uses simple token-based authentication passed as a URL parameter, and returns customer records wrapped in a superfluous customer JSON object that we want the connector to peel off as it's not useful to recipe authors using it:\nGET https://api.my-app.com/v1/customers.json?id=1234&api_token=xyz\n{\n  \"customer\": {\n    \"id\": 1234,\n    \"name\": \"John Smith\",\n    \"email\": \"john.smith@email.com\",\n    \"address\": {\n      \"street\": \"123 Main St\",\n      \"city\": \"Anytown\",\n      \"state\": \"CA\",\n      \"zip\": \"94321\",\n      \"country\": \"USA\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nA request to do the above could be written in a custom connector as:\nget('https://api.my-app.com/v1/customers.json?id=1234&api_token=xyz')['customer']\n\nor\nget('https://api.my-app.com/v1/customers.json').params(id: 1234, api_token: 'xyz')['customer']\n\nRequest execution\nLet's dissect the different parts of the second form of the request above:\nget('https://api.my-app.com/v1/customers.json').params(id: 1234, api_token: 'xyz')['customer']\n\nThis chains three method calls:\n\nCreate the base request.\nMix in more request options.\nAccess the response, at which point the request is lazy-executed.\n\nBase request\nGET https://api.my-app.com/v1/customers.json\nget('https://api.my-app.com/v1/customers.json')\n\nNo request has been made yet: The result so far is the cued-up request for the base URL, and with the request and expected response format set to the default, JSON.\nMix in request options\nid=1234&api_token=xyz\nparams(id: 1234, api_token: 'xyz')\n\nparams is one of the methods available on the request object, adding URL parameters, which are passed as a hash object.  More methods can be similarly chained to mix in other aspects of the request that is to be made:\n\npayload\nPayload fields (PATCH, POST, PUT only), also passed as a hash.\n\nheaders\nRequest headers, passed as a hash\n\nMethods to change the request/response (or both) formats from the JSON default:\nrequest_format_json, response_format_json, format_json, request_format_xml, response_format_xml, format_xml, request_format_www_form_urlencoded\n\nHTTP authentication\nuser, password\n\n\nExecute request and process the response\n  ['customer']\n\nBy calling any method ([] here) that is not a request option, the connector signals that it is time to make the request so that we can process the API response.  In this JSON default case, the response is parsed into a ruby hash:\n{\n  \"customer\" => {\n    \"id\" => 1234,\n    \"name\" => \"John Smith\",\n    \"email\" => \"john.smith@email.com\",\n    \"address\" => {\n      \"street\" => \"123 Main St\",\n      \"city\" => \"Anytown\",\n      \"state\" => \"CA\",\n      \"zip\" => \"94321\",\n      \"country\" => \"USA\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nWhich then has the ['customer'] method evaluated on it, peeling off the customer envelope and resulting in the action's output:\n{\n  \"id\" => 1234,\n  \"name\" => \"John Smith\",\n  \"email\" => \"john.smith@email.com\",\n    \"address\" => {\n      \"street\" => \"123 Main St\",\n      \"city\" => \"Anytown\",\n      \"state\" => \"CA\",\n      \"zip\" => \"94321\",\n      \"country\" => \"USA\"\n    }\n}\n\nSchema - describing input/output\nThere are several components where the connector needs to describe the expected fields for input, output or configuration.  This is done using schema notation:\n[\n  { name: \"id\", type: :integer },\n  { name: \"name\" },\n  { name: \"email\" },\n  {\n    name: \"address\",\n    type: :object,\n    properties: [\n      { name: \"street\" },\n      { name: \"city\" },\n      { name: \"zip\" },\n      { name: \"country\" }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n\nConnector components\nWith these basics out of the way, we can now walk through an example connector, and show how its various parts relate to how users will edit and run recipes.\n{\n  title: 'My sample connector',\n\n  connection: {\n\nConnection fields\nThe optional connection fields use the schema notation to describe the connection configuration fields, if any are needed.  Using the example API above that requires an api_token URL parameter, this might be:\n    fields: [\n      {\n        name: 'api_token',\n        label: 'API token',\n        optional: false,\n        hint: 'You can find your MyApp API token under \"Account Settings\"'\n      }\n    ],\n\nuse the schema notation to describe the connection's properties, shown wherever the connection configuration is displayed, for example in the recipe's connection tab:\n\nAuthorization\nconnection can optionally also contain an authorization component to consolidate the API's authorization logic.  authorization can contain several components, its most important one being apply, which lets us define request options that will be added to any API request made by the connector:\n    authorization: {\n      apply: lambda do |connection|\n        params(api_token: connection['api_token'])\n      end\n    },\n\nThis way our requests don't need to repeat the authorization options:\nget('https://api.my-app.com/v1/customers.json').params(id: 1234)['customer']\n\nConnection test\nBack outside connection, the test component lets the connection be tested, e.g. to make sure the credentials, like api_token in this example, are still valid.\n  },\n\n  test: lambda do |connection|\n    get('https://api.my-app.com/v1/customers.json').params(limit: 1)\n  end,\n\nAs long as the lambda does not raise an exception, the connection is considered live.  It is invoked:\n\nWith non-OAuth connectors only: when the Connect button is clicked.\n\nIn all cases:  When starting a recipe, each connection used in it has the corresponding test called; starting the recipe fails if any test raises an error.\n\n\nActions\n  actions: {\n    get_customer_by_id: {\n\nInput form\nWhen one of the connector's actions is used in a recipe, its input form is based on its input_fields lambda, which also uses the schema notation.\nContinuing with our \"get customer by ID\" action example:\n      input_fields: lambda do\n        [\n          { name: 'id', type: :integer, optional: false }\n        ]\n      end,\n\n\nOutput tree\nUsing the same schema notation, output_fields describes the action's output that will appear downstream in the recipe job data:\n      output_fields: lambda do\n        [\n          { name: \"id\", type: :integer },\n          { name: \"name\" },\n          { name: \"email\" },\n          {\n            name: \"address\",\n            type: :object,\n            properties: [\n              { name: \"street\" },\n              { name: \"city\" },\n              { name: \"zip\" },\n              { name: \"country\" }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      end,\n\n\nexecute\nAt runtime, when the job reaches a recipe line that uses this action, its execute lambda is called.\n\nThe first argument is the connection fields, packaged in a hash object.\n\nThe second argument is the action's input, evaluated based on how the input form is configured in the recipe.  Also packaged as a hash object.\n\n\nAs discussed earlier, the execute lambda makes the request.  The result, lazy-evaluated either within the lambda or right after it returns, is expected to contain the specified output fields.\n      execute: lambda do |connection, input|\n        get('https://api.my-app.com/v1/customers.json').params(id: input['id'])['customer']\n      end\n\n    } # get_customer_by_id\n  }, # actions:\n\nTriggers\n  triggers: {\n    new_customer: {\n\nInput form\nSame as the one for actions\nOutput tree\nSimilar to actions, but describes what each one of the collection of records that the trigger's poll (see below) contains.\nPolling for trigger events\nThere are two types of trigger, to cater to two common patterns in such API endpoints: \"Ascending\" (the default), and \"paging\", a.k.a. descending.\n\"Ascending\" endpoints\nThese are API endpoints that list records in the same order as we would want them consumed.  This is typically ascending in creation or modification time.\nGET /v1/customers.json?created_since=2017-01-01T12:00:00Z&order=asc&limit=100\n{\n  \"customers\": [\n     {\n       id: 1234,\n       created_at: \"2017-01-02T12:34:56Z\",\n       ...\n     },\n     ... (up to 100 total customer records)\n     {\n       id: 2345,\n       created_at: \"2017-01-03T12:34:56Z\",\n       ...\n     }\n  ]\n}\n\npoll\n    new_customer_ascending: {\n      poll: lambda do |connection, input, last_created_since|\n        created_since = last_created_since || input['created_since']\n        customers = get('https://api.my-app.com/v1/customers.json').\n                      params(created_since: created_since.iso8601,\n                             order: 'asc',\n                             limit: 100)['customers'] || []\n        {\n          events: customers,\n          next_poll: (customers.length > 0 && customers.last['created_at'] ||\n                        created_since),\n          can_poll_more: (customers.length >= 100)\n        }\n      end,\n\nThe poll response contains three parts:\nevents\nThis is the array of events polled (customer objects in this case), out of which jobs may be started with the recipe.\nnext_poll\nAn object to be passed as the last argument (named to last_created_since in this example) to the next poll cycle.  Use this to maintain a \"cursor\" for the next request.\ncan_poll_more\nA flag that informs the runtime whether more results may be immediately available.  If true, a further poll will be made (almost) immediately.\ndedup\n      dedup: lambda do |customer|\n        customer['id']\n      end,\n    }, # closing out the trigger\n\nIt is not always possible to prevent the same record from appearing in separate poll invocations.  To avoid duplicate recipe jobs, the runtime uses dedup, passing it each item returned in events.  The output is a unique identifier associated with the recipe job that results from that item.\nFor triggers that track the creation of new objects, the unique identifier is typically the application-specific unique ID for that object.\nAnother common trigger pattern is tracking object modification.  To reflect that, the connector would typically mix the object's modification timestamp into the event's unique ID:\n\"#{customer['id']}@#{customer['modified_at']}\"\n\n\"Descending\" endpoints\nThese are endpoints that list records in the opposite order from the one we want them consumed.\nGET /v1/customers.json?created_since=2017-01-01T12:00:00Z&created_before=2017-01-21T00:00:00Z&order=desc&limit=100\n{\n  \"customers\": [\n     {\n       id: 9876,\n       created_at: \"2017-01-20T12:34:56Z\",\n       ...\n     }\n     ... (up to 100 total customer records)\n     {\n       id: 8765,\n       created_at: \"2017-01-19T12:34:56Z\",\n       ...\n     }\n  ]\n}\n\npoll\nThe polling strategy for these endpoints is to \"page\" backwards, until we reach the beginning of the result set (or results we have processed before).  At that point the runtime handles creating the recipe jobs in the \"correct\" order.\n    new_customer_descending: {\n      type: :paging_desc, # marks this as a \"descending\" trigger\n\n      poll: lambda do |connection, input, last_created_before|\n        created_before = last_created_before || Time.now\n        customers = get('https://api.my-app.com/v1/customers.json').\n                      params(created_since: input['created_since'].iso8601,\n                             created_before: created_before.iso8601,\n                             order: 'desc',\n                             limit: 100)['customers'] || []\n        {\n          events: customers,\n          next_page: (customers.length >= 100 && customers.last['created_at']).presence\n        }\n      end,\n\nThis trigger variant's poll response contains two parts:\nevents\nSimilar to the ascending variant's events, but expected to be in descending order.\nnext_page\nIf present (not nil), this signals the runtime that there may be more, \"earlier\", events available in the endpoint.\nThis value will be passed to the next poll as the third argument, named last_created_before in this example.\nIn comparison with the ascending trigger variant, this value plays the roles of both the \"cursor\" (next_poll) and poll timing hint (can_poll_more).\nThe connector doesn't need to keep track of how far we can go before we encounter already-seen events; the runtime handles that state, in combination with the rest of the descending trigger components:\ndocument_id\n      document_id: lambda do |customer|\n        customer['id']\n      end,\n\nExtracts the unique ID of the underlying object.  This is optional, if absent then the default behavior is to use the field called id (case insensitive) in the object (the example above just illustrates the default).\nNote: This is not the same as dedup below.\nsort_by\n      sort_by: lambda do |customer|\n        customer['created_at']\n      end,\n\nExtracts a sorting/ranking value for the underlying object, so the runtime can determine whether we have polled \"far enough\" backwards.\ndedup\n      dedup: lambda do |customer|\n        \"#{customer['id']}@#{customer['created_at']}\"\n      end\n    }, # closing out the trigger\n\nPerforms the same de-duplication logic as in the case of ascending triggers.  However in the case of descending triggers it is optional; example above is the default, of combining the result of document_id and sort_by, separated by a @ character.\nComplete connector\nAt this point, after closing the remaining \"open\" braces in the connector description:\n  } # triggers\n} # top-level connector hash\n\nThe connector should be ready to be used.\n"},"developing-connectors/sdk/authentication.html":{"url":"developing-connectors/sdk/authentication.html","title":"Authentication","keywords":"","body":"Authentication\n\nBasic Authentication\nOAuth 2.0\nCustom Authentication\nTest\n\n"},"developing-connectors/sdk/authentication/basic-authentication.html":{"url":"developing-connectors/sdk/authentication/basic-authentication.html","title":"Basic auth","keywords":"","body":"Basic Authentication\nStandard\nTypically, a basic authentication requires a username and password combination when making requests.

It should be used as a username with a blank password in the standard basic authentication format.\nSo, to adjust the connections portion of the code to suit this behaviour, simply request for an API instead of username + password.\nIn the apply section, pass the api_key into user() and an empty string (\"\") to password()\nconnection: {\n\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: \"api_token\",\n      control_type: \"password\",\n      label: \"API token\",\n      optional: false,\n      hint: \"Available in 'My Profile' page\"\n    }\n  ],\n\n  authorization: {\n    type: \"basic_auth\",\n\n    # Toggl API expect the token to be sent as user name and the string 'api_token' as the password\n    # curl -u \"{your api_token}:api_token\" \"https://www.toggl.com/api/v8/me\"\n    apply: lambda do |connection|\n      user(connection[\"api_token\"])\n      password(\"api_token\")\n    end\n  }\n}\n\nAnother variation is to have a generated api_token replace the user name and have the string \"api_token\" replacing password in the basic authentication format.\nAPI Key Authentication\nFor APIs that expect API Key authentication, it is a slight variation from the basic authentication code above.\nMake sure to include the required inputs from the user (subdomain, api_key, scope etc)\nDefine\n\ntype: \"api_key\"\nthe appropriate parameter name for the API Key.

Returning the access token under a key of accessToken in a JSON response will result in an unsuccessful Workato request to your token_url.\nUsually this will not be a problem because most OAuth libraries out there will do most of the heavy lifting for you, such as returning response in the right format etc. It is good to be aware of this!\n\n\n\n"},"developing-connectors/sdk/authentication/custom-authentication.html":{"url":"developing-connectors/sdk/authentication/custom-authentication.html","title":"Custom auth","keywords":"","body":"Custom Authentication\nOccasionally, the API requires an authentication mechanism different from the typical ones.

You can write the require code here to acquire and store relevant credentials data to be used in the apply block.\nacquire: lambda do |connection|\n  {\n    authtoken:\n      get('https://accounts.zoho.com/apiauthtoken/nb/create').\n      params('SCOPE' => 'ZohoCRM/crmapi',\n             'EMAIL_ID' => connection['email'],\n             'PASSWORD' => connection['password'],\n             'DISPLAY_NAME' => 'Workato test adapter').\n      response_format_raw[/(?\nThe output of this block should be a hash, which will be merged with the original connection object.\nThis API request to the Auth token endpoint returns a raw text response with the Auth token like this:\nAUTHTOKEN=bad18eba1ff45jk7858b8ae88a77fa30\nRESULT=TRUE\nAs a result, the connection object is merged with this value after executing the acquire block.\nOriginal connection object\n{\n  \"email\": \"john@gmail.com\",\n  \"password\": \"pinkfloyd\"\n}\n\nconnection object after executing acquire block\n{\n  \"email\": \"john@gmail.com\",\n  \"password\": \"pinkfloyd\",\n  \"authtoken\": \"SAMPLE_TOKEN\"\n}\n\nThis new connection object will be passed into all actions, triggers, test and pick lists as the connection argument.\n\nThe \"apply\" block will not be applied to any requests made in \"acquire\". So you will have to include the required credentials for a successful API request here.\n\nrefresh_on\nThis is an optional array of signals that is used to identify a need to re-acquire credentials . When an erroneous response is received (400, 401, 500...), the SDK framework checks it against this list of signals. If a match is found, it triggers a re-authorization (execute acquire).\nThis list is optional. If not defined, will default to one attempt at re-acquiring credentials for all errors.\nrefresh_on: [\n  401,\n  'Unauthorized',\n  /Unauthorized/,\n  /Invalid Ticket Id/\n]\n\nThe example here shows multiple ways that we can define \"signals\" to watch.\n\n401: The response status code\n\"Unauthorized\": The exact string matching the whole body or title of response\n/Unauthorized/: Regex matching the body or title of response\n/Invalid Ticket Id/: The actual \"message\" to watch for in the case of the Zoho API\n\ndetect_on\nCertain APIs don't signal errors with explicit response status code like a 401. Instead, they return a 200 (pseudo successful response) with a payload that signals the error.\nFor such APIs, an error (expired credentials, bad requests etc.) will not be picked up since it is interpreted as a successful request (Status code 200). A match with the signals defined here will raise an error.\nWhen there is a match here, two things can happen.\nFirstly, there can also be a match against refresh_on signals. When that happens, a re-authorization is triggered (acquire block is executed) instead of raising an error. In this case, detect_on is used to match errors hidden behind responses with status code 200, then used to identify that a credentials refresh is required.\nIf a match here does not match any of the signals defined in refresh_on, an error will be raised.\ndetect_on: [\n  \"sample error message\",\n  /^\\{\"response\":\\{\"error\".+$/\n]\n\nThe example here shows multiple ways that we can define \"signals\" to watch\n\n\"sample error message\": The exact string matching the whole body of response\n/^\\{\"response\":\\{\"error\".+$/: Regex matching the body of response\n\nThis list is optional. If not defined, pseudo successful response will be treated as a successful request instead of raising exceptions. Note: output values of trigger and action will be affected.\n"},"developing-connectors/sdk/authentication/test.html":{"url":"developing-connectors/sdk/authentication/test.html","title":"Test","keywords":"","body":"Test\nTest endpoint to ensure that connection is successful.\nTypically, this should be a request that will always be accessible to any user.\nHere are some examples:\ntest: lambda do |connection|\n  get(\"https://person.clearbit.com/v1/people/email/eeshansim@gmail.com\")\nend\n\ntest: lambda do |connection|\n  get(\"https://app.clicktime.com/api/1.3/session\")\nend\n\n"},"developing-connectors/sdk/object-definition.html":{"url":"developing-connectors/sdk/object-definition.html","title":"Object definition","keywords":"","body":"Object Definition\nObject Definitions is an important component of the SDK.

More often than not, the object is much more complex, with multiple levels of nesting. This section aims to illustrate how to define nested fields.\nNested object\nTake this sample User JSON from Okta:\n{\n  \"id\": \"00ub0oNGTSWTBKOLGLNR\",\n  \"status\": \"STAGED\",\n  \"created\": \"2013-07-02T21:36:25.344Z\",\n  \"activated\": null,\n  \"lastLogin\": \"2013-07-02T21:36:25.344Z\",\n  \"profile\": {\n    \"firstName\": \"Isaac\",\n    \"lastName\": \"Brock\",\n    \"email\": \"isaac.brock@example.com\",\n    \"login\": \"isaac.brock@example.com\",\n    \"mobilePhone\": \"555-415-1337\"\n  },\n  \"credentials\": {\n    \"provider\": {\n      \"type\": \"OKTA\",\n      \"name\": \"OKTA\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"_links\": {\n    \"activate\": {\n      \"href\": \"https://your-domain.okta.com/api/v1/users/00ub0oNGTSWTBKOLGLNR/lifecycle/activate\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nNested object field profile can be defined type: :object with fields nested inside using properties. Properties should be an array of fields objects (just like fields within the user object).\nobject_definitions: {\n  user: {\n    fields: lambda do\n      [\n        {\n          name: \"id\"\n        },\n        {\n          name: \"status\"\n        },\n        {\n          name: \"created\",\n          type: :timestamp\n        },\n        {\n          name: \"activated\",\n          type: :timestamp\n        },\n        {\n          name: \"lastLogin\",\n          type: :timestamp\n        },\n        {\n          name: \"profile\",\n          type: :object,\n          properties: [\n            {\n              name: \"firstName\"\n            },\n            {\n              name: \"lastName\"\n            },\n            {\n              name: \"email\",\n              control_type: :email\n            },\n            {\n              name: \"login\",\n              control_type: :email\n            },\n            {\n              name: \"mobilePhone\",\n              control_type: :phone\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    end\n  }\n}\n\nNested Arrays\nThe other common type of nested field is array of objects. This type of field contains a list of repeated objects of the same fields. The defining such fields will be very similar to defining objects. Take the following sample user object from Asana for instance.\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"id\": 12149914544379,\n    \"email\": \"eeshan@workato.com\",\n    \"name\": \"Ee Shan\",\n    \"workspaces\": [\n      {\n        \"id\": 1041269201604,\n        \"name\": \"Workato\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": 498346130780,\n        \"name\": \"Product Documentation\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nThe workspaces array should be given type: :array as well as of: :object. This tells the object_definitions framework that the field contains an array of objects. Similar to nested objects, you will need to define properties, which is an array of fields corresponding to the fields of each object in the workspaces array.\nobject_definitions: {\n  user: {\n    fields: lambda do\n      [\n        {\n          name: 'id',\n          type: :integer\n        },\n        { name: 'name' },\n        {\n          name: 'email',\n          control_type: :phone\n        },\n        {\n          name: 'workspaces',\n          type: :array,\n          of: :object,\n          properties: [\n            {\n              name: 'id',\n              label: 'Workspace ID',\n              type: :integer\n            },\n            { name: 'name' }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    end\n  }\n}\n\n"},"developing-connectors/sdk/toggle-field.html":{"url":"developing-connectors/sdk/toggle-field.html","title":"Toggle field","keywords":"","body":"Toggle Fields\nToggle fields are a special type of input fields that allow 2 input types. This is useful in a scenario where there are 2 ways to provide an input value for an action or trigger. It is typically used for input fields that are primarily a pick list but may require a text type in certain scenarios.\nHere we have an example toggle field parser_id used in the Docparser connector. The action, Fetch document from URL, requires the parser ID as an input. This ID can be accessed within the parser page URL. However, that is not a great user experience for the recipe builder. Ideally, we want users to be able to stay on the recipe page without having to toggle (pun intended) between browser tabs.\nHence, we introduced the parser pick list. This pick list is dynamically generated from the user's list of parsers. For details of pick lists, checkout Pick list\nfetch_document_from_url: {\n  input_fields: lambda do\n    [\n      { \n        name: \"url\", \n        label: \"Source URL\",\n        hint: \"Upload file from this URL\",\n        optional: false \n      },\n      {\n        name: \"parser_id\",\n        label: \"Document Parser\",\n        hint: \"The Document Parser the file gets imported to\",\n        control_type: :select,\n        pick_list: \"parsers\",\n        optional: false,\n        toggle_hint: \"Select from list\",\n        toggle_field: {\n          name: \"parser_id\",\n          label: \"Parser ID\",\n          type: :string,\n          control_type: \"text\",\n          optional: false,\n          toggle_hint: \"Use custom value\",\n          hint: \"Go to home page and select the required parser. If the URL is 'https://app.docparser.com/stack/ynrqkdxvaghs/overview', then 'ynrqkdxvaghs' is the ID\"\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        name: \"remote_id\",\n        sticky: true\n      }\n    ]\n  end,\n\n  execute: lambda do |connection, input|\n      post(\"https://api.docparser.com/v1/document/fetch/#{input[\"parser_id\"]}?url=#{input[\"url\"]}\")\n  end,\n\n  output_fields: lambda do |object_definitions|\n      object_definitions[\"document\"]\n  end\n}\n\nA pick list input type is used to create a more desired user experience. However, this makes the action value mapping static. Because the pick list can only select a single value, all recipe jobs executing this action will use the single parser ID value selected. To overcome this limitation, a text field should be used. A text field allows dynamic mapping of input field value.\nIn this case, both field types are desired, so we decided to use a toggle_field to provide both input options to users. Since, it is a more common scenario for users to select a parser per action, pick list type is set as the primary toggle and text field set as the secondary (nested toggle_field).\nToggle field in recipe\nToggle primary field\n\nToggle secondary field\n\ntoggle_hint\nToggle hints are displayed in the toggle dropdown when choosing between primary and secondary options. This is an optional field but should be added as best practice. A toggle_hint defined in the primary field will be displayed as a hint for choosing the primary field. The same applies for toggle_hint for secondary field.\n\ntoggle_field\ntoggle_field should be defined as a hash nested in the primary field. Within this hash should be a definition of a typical field. This means that the toggle_field hash should contain all the fields required for a field.\nNote: toggle_field keys do not have default behaviours. This means that all fields are required and must be explicitly defined.

A poll trigger constantly executes a poll block for new events at fixed time intervals. This time interval depends on a user's subscription (5 or 10 minutes). At the same time, it is also able to support pagination. This is useful to prevent request timeouts when making requests with large response results. A trigger can execute immediate consecutive polls to retrieve events from successive pages.\nThere are two types of trigger. The classic trigger type is used by default if type is not specified. The other type is called the \"paging_desc\" trigger, which can be used only for endpoints that provide events sorted in descending order. This trigger type has an auto-paging mechanism that lets you build a simple and efficient trigger. (described in detail below)\nA ruby hash is returned in each poll. This hash should contain a few keys. The array of events, or data, should be passed into the events key. At the same time, a cursor is saved in next_page/next_poll (depending on the trigger type). This cursor provides information about where the current poll stopped, and used in the next poll. A classic type trigger has an additional key can_poll_more, which can be defined to conditionally fire immediate polls for multi-page results.\nClassic Trigger\nNo need to define any type to use the classic trigger.

This is frequently used to access domain or subdomain information from the user.\ninput provides access to trigger input field values from the recipe. Inputs like \"created_since\" a particular date is usually used in a trigger to allow filtering historic records. In this case, Knack does not provide filtering by record created dates, input is given an empty array.\nThe last argument, usually given the name last_updated_since or last_created_since, is the cursor \"stored\" from a previous poll. This is crucial to a good trigger design. It is used to determine where the last poll stopped and where to begin next. As an example, it is usually given the last (latest) \"updated\"/\"created\" time. When the trigger is first started, this value is nil.\nOutput\npoll: lambda do |connection, input, last_updated_since|\n  page_size = 100\n  updated_since = (last_updated_since || input['since']).to_time.utc.iso8601\n\n  tickets = get(\"https://#{connection['helpdesk']}.freshdesk.com/api/v2/tickets.json\").\n            params(order_by: 'updated_at',\n                   order_type: 'asc',\n                   per_page: page_size,\n                   updated_since: updated_since)\n\n  next_updated_since = tickets.last['updated_at'] unless tickets.blank?\n\n  {\n    events: tickets,\n    next_poll: next_updated_since,\n    can_poll_more: tickets.length >= page_size\n  }\nend\n\nIn a classic type trigger, the expected output contains events, next_poll and can_poll_more.\nevents expects an array of individual results to be processed through the recipe as individual events.\nnext_poll is a cursor that will be passed on to the successive poll (third argument of poll block.\nImportant:\nThis trigger type does not have automatic-immediate polling. Immediate polling is determined by can_poll_more, which is a boolean value for whether an immediate poll should be made.\nExample JSON response:\n[\n  {\n    \"id\": 1,\n    \"updated_at\": \"2016-08-13T00:53:44Z\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": 2,\n    \"updated_at\": \"2016-09-14T02:25:00Z\"\n  },\n  ...\n]\n\nWhen a get request receives this JSON response, it looks up the array for the last record (latest record) and passes it as the cursor for the next poll. It also checks the response array size. If it is equal to the size limit, it is likely that there are more records matching this request in consequtive pages. Hence the expression given to can_poll_more evaluates to true and invokes an immediate successive poll. This loop continues until response array size is smaller than page limit.\nAt the end of the loop. The last (latest) created date is passed as next_poll. This value will be used in the next poll cycle to pick up new records.\ndedup\nDedup block is used to identify individual events. It is given a single argument \"event\", which corresponds to individual elements in the records array passed into \"events\".\nA typical dedup input is event[‘id’] where the event argument name can be replaced to make the code more readable. This should be used only in classic triggers.\ndedup: lambda do |ticket|\n  ticket[\"id\"]\nend\n\nIn some instances, a record needs to be proccessed as separate events. A typical scenario is updated records. To do this, append updated timestamp field to the dedup expression like so.\ndedup: lambda do |ticket|\n  ticket[\"id\"] + \"@\" + ticket[\"updated_at\"]\nend\n\nWith this, 2 occurence of a record with the same \"ID\" but with different \"updated_at\" values will be recorded as separate events.\nDescending Trigger\nnew_alert: {\n  type: :paging_desc,\n\n  input_fields: lambda do\n    [\n      {\n        name: 'since',\n        type: :timestamp,\n        optional: false\n      }\n    ]\n  end,\n\n  poll: lambda do |connection, input, page|\n    limit = 100\n    page ||= 0\n    created_since = (input['since'] || Time.now).to_i\n    offset = (limit * page)\n\n    response = get(\"https://api.pingdom.com/api/2.0/actions\").\n                 params(from: created_since,\n                        limit: limit,\n                        offset: offset)\n\n    {\n      events: response,\n      next_page: (response.length >= limit) ? page + 1 : nil\n    }\n  end,\n\n  document_id: lambda do |response|\n    response['checkid']\n  end,\n\n  sort_by: lambda do |response|\n    response['time']\n  end,\n\n  output_fields: lambda do |object_definitions|\n    object_definitions['alert']\n  end\n}\n\ntype\ntype: :paging_desc - This type should be used only if results are in descending order. A paging_desc trigger works by assuming a descending order and continuously poll for all unique records. If the API is unable to return records in descending order, ignore this key to use the classic trigger.\nA record of all event IDs (defined in document_id ) is recorded for each recipe. Each recipe will \"remember\" all event IDs that is processed through a trigger. \nBased on assumption of order, the trigger can stop the polling cycle once a similar event IDs is observed. This is because further polls will return events \"before\" and would have already been processed by the trigger. At this point, the trigger stops polling and wait for the new poll cycle for new events. The Workato trigger framework handles deduplication in the background.\npoll\nPoll block is where you define how events are obtained. Typically, a GET request is used to retrieve a list of records to be processed as trigger events.\nArguments\nDescending trigger polls have the exact same argument structure. connection, input and cursor. The one difference is that the last argument is usually given the name page. In a descending trigger, this argument is usually used to pass the page number instead of record timestamp.\nOutput\nSimilar to a classic trigger, the events in output here expects an array of results.\npoll: lambda do |connection, input, page|\n  limit = 100\n  page ||= 0\n  created_since = (input['since'] || Time.now).to_i\n  offset = (limit * page)\n\n  response = get(\"https://api.pingdom.com/api/2.0/actions\").\n               params(from: created_since,\n                      limit: limit,\n                      offset: offset)\n\n  {\n    events: response,\n    next_page: (response.length >= limit) ? page + 1 : nil\n  }\nend\n\nInstead of next_poll, paging_desc type trigger should be given next_page as cursor. It is used for passing the next page to be polled.\nA typical response looks like this.\n{\n  \"current\": \"https://api.sample.com/records?order=desc&from=2016-12-09T22%3A57%3A13Z&page=1\",\n  \"next\": \"https://api.sample.com/records?order=desc&from=2016-12-09T22%3A57%3A13Z&page=2\",\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"checkid\": 123,\n      \"time\": \"2016-12-13T19:09:01Z\",\n      ...\n    },\n    {\n      \"checkid\": 124,\n      \"time\": \"2016-12-10T06:20:00Z\",\n      ...\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nresponse[\"data\"] is an array of results from the request, which should be passed to events. While it varies between APIs, most will provide some form of pointer to the next page of results. In this example,response[\"next\"] is an API generated url to be used to retrieve the next page of results matching the request. Hence we can simply pass it to next_page. In the successive poll, this value is passed to the poll block and the next set of records is retrieved.\nOn the last page, response[\"next\"] is usually null. In that case, it will cause the successive poll to make the same request as in the first page. When this happens, the trigger framework detects a duplicate event (mechanism for detection explained in detail later) and halts all immediate polls. At this point, the trigger goes to \"sleep\" until the next poll cycle.\nNew records being added in the cloud instance will appear in the first page of requests since records are returned in descending order. The trigger picks up new records and processes them until a duplicate event is detected, at which point it \"sleeps\". This trigger type depends on a descending order to retrieve only \"new\" records and stops upon detection of \"old\" records.\nThis way, the trigger polls for new records efficiently, without making any repeated requests to retrieve the entire set of records in each poll cycle.\ndocument_id\nSimilar to dedup, paging_desc type triggers uses document_id to identify unique records. Write an expression that can uniquely identify the \"ID\" of records.\ndocument_id: lambda do |event|\n  event[\"checkid\"]\nend\n\nUnlike classic triggers, there is no need to include timestamp fields into the document_id expression to deduplicate updated records. Descending triggers have an additional block sort_by to process this.\nsort_by\nIn addition to document_id, this block is used to define the field that is used to sort records (in descending order). It could be \"created_at\" or \"updated_at\" or similar fields.\nsort_by: lambda do |event|\n  event[\"time\"]\nend\n\n"},"developing-connectors/sdk/trigger/webhook-trigger.html":{"url":"developing-connectors/sdk/trigger/webhook-trigger.html","title":"Dynamic webhook trigger","keywords":"","body":"Dynamic Webhook Trigger\ntriggers: {\n  new_message: {\n    type: :paging_desc,\n\n    input_fields: lambda do |object_definitions|\n      object_definitions[\"room\"].only(\"id\")\n    end,\n\n    webhook_subscribe: lambda do |webhook_url, connection, input, recipe_id|\n      post(\"https://api.ciscospark.com/v1/webhooks\",\n           name: \"Workato recipe #{recipe_id}\",\n           targetUrl: webhook_url,\n           resource: \"messages\",\n           event: \"created\",\n           filter: \"roomId=#{input['id']}\")\n    end,\n\n    webhook_notification: lambda do |input, payload|\n      payload[\"data\"]\n    end,\n\n    webhook_unsubscribe: lambda do |webhook|\n      delete(\"https://api.ciscospark.com/v1/webhooks/#{webhook['id']}\")\n    end,\n\n    dedup: lambda do |message) {\n      message[\"id\"]\n    end,\n\n    output_fields: lambda do |object_definitions|\n      object_definitions[\"message\"]\n    end\n  }\n}\n\nwebhook_subscribe\nWhen a recipe is started, a webhook subscription should be created.

Let's break it down. Firstly, we define a POST to request to the appropriate endpoint:\npost(\"https://api.intacct.com/ia/xml/xmlgw.phtml\")\n\nNext, we add a payload to the request in the form of a hash first:\n.payload(\"control\": [\n         {\n           \"senderid\": [{ \"content!\": connection[\"sender_id\"] }],\n           \"password\": [{ \"content!\": connection[\"sender_password\"] }],\n           \"controlid\": [{ \"content!\": \"testControlId\" }],\n           \"uniqueid\": [{ \"content!\": false }],\n           \"dtdversion\": [{ \"content!\": 3.0 }]\n         }\n       ],\n       \"operation\": [\n         {\n           \"authentication\": [\n             {\n               \"login\": [\n                 {\n                   \"userid\": [{ \"content!\": connection[\"login_username\"] }],\n                   \"companyid\": [{ \"content!\": connection[\"company_id\"] }],\n                   \"password\": [{ \"content!\": connection[\"login_password\"] }]\n                 }\n               ]\n             }\n           ],\n           \"content\": [\n             {\n               \"function\": [\n                 {\n                   \"@controlid\": \"testControlId\",\n                   \"get_list\": [\n                     {\n                       \"@object\": \"glaccount\",\n                       \"@maxitems\": \"1\"\n                     }\n                   ]\n                 }\n               ]\n             }\n           ]\n         }\n       ])\n\nElements are represented by arrays of hashes, since XML elements can repeat without any extra notation. Element data is defined using the content! key and attributes using @ prefix (example: @object and @maxitems).\nThe resultant XML body looks like this:\n\n  SENDER_ID\n  PASSWORD\n  testControlId\n  false\n  3.0\n\n\n  \n    \n      USER_ID\n      COMPANY_ID\n      PASSWORD\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nDefining value for an XML element is done using the content! key. For example, to assign password to the  element, the hash looks like this:\n{\n  \"senderid\": [{ \"content!\": connection[\"sender_id\"] }]\n}\n\nNext, how do we form a complex XML element? First, let's form an XML element that has a single occurrence (object type). For example, the  element in the request body is a complex element type with a number of elements nested within. The resultant partial XML should look like this:\n\n  SENDER_ID\n  PASSWORD\n  testControlId\n  false\n  3.0\n\n\nTo form this, the equivalent hash should not have content! defined immediately in the control hash. Instead, defind an array of a single hash that contains nested keys, one for each element that belongs in the  element.\n\"control\": [\n  {\n    \"senderid\": [{ \"content!\": connection[\"sender_id\"] }],\n    \"password\": [{ \"content!\": connection[\"sender_password\"] }],\n    \"controlid\": [{ \"content!\": \"testControlId\" }],\n    \"uniqueid\": [{ \"content!\": false }],\n    \"dtdversion\": [{ \"content!\": 3.0 }]\n  }\n]\n\nNotice that all elements immediately under the  element are primitive types. Each of these elements contain only a value and optionally, attributes.\nNow, we know how to define values for primitive XML elements. What about XML attributes? Let's look at the  element in the XML body to see how it's done.\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\nThis XML element has attributes defined in 2 elements. First, in a complex element  as well as a primitive element . To form this XML, the equivalent hash structure looks like this:\n\"content\": [\n  {\n    \"function\": [\n      {\n        \"@controlid\": \"testControlId\",\n        \"get_list\": [\n          {\n            \"@object\": \"glaccount\",\n            \"@maxitems\": \"1\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n\nAttributes and nested elements in a complex XML element are defined with the same hierarchy, but with the @ prefix to indicate an attribute. (\"get_list\" key for  element and \"@controlid\" key for controlid attribute)\nSimilarly, element value and attributes in a primitive XML element are defined with the same hierarchy. (\"content!\" key for value of  element and \"@object\" key for object attribute)\nIn this example, the  element is not assigned a value. If we were to assign one, the equivalent hash will look like this:\n\"content\": [\n  {\n    \"function\": [\n      {\n        \"@controlid\": \"testControlId\",\n        \"get_list\": [\n          {\n            \"@object\": \"glaccount\",\n            \"@maxitems\": \"1\",\n            \"content!\": input[\"key\"]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n\nWhich will be converted into this XML:\n\n  \n    KEY_VALUE\n  \n\n\nNext, we add the necessary headers with the headers shorthand method:\n.headers(\"Content-type\": \"x-intacct-xml-request\")\n\nFinally, we use the format_xml method (since we require both request and response in XML) and pass it the root element name as an argument, )\n.format_xml(\"request\")\n\nHandling XML from response\nNow, the response from the same request will be in this form:\n\n  \n    success\n    SENDER_ID\n    testControlId\n    false\n    3.0\n  \n  \n    \n      success\n      USER_ID\n      COMPANY_ID\n      2017-03-26T05:24:25-07:00\n    \n    \n      success\n      get_list\n      testControlId\n      glaccount\n      \n        \n          1\n          1000\n          Chase Operating Account\n          debit\n          balancesheet\n          closed to account\n          \n          06/03/2016 20:19:30\n          active\n          false\n          false\n          false\n          \n          \n          None\n          false\n          false\n          false\n          false\n          false\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nBecause format_xml was called in the request, Workato SDK returns an equivalent hash. Similar to request:\n\nelements are represented by arrays of hashes, since XML elements can repeat without any extra notation\nelements attributes has @ prefixed with the same heirarchy as nested elements and element values\nelement values are passed as values of the \"content!\" key{\n\"response\"=>[\n  {\n    \"control\"=>[\n      {\n        \"status\"=>[{ \"content!\"=>\"success\" }],\n

available. Methods are whitelisted to ensure security. The Workato SDK Framework also exposes some methods to make building SDKs convenient.\nHere is a list of methods available:\nREST verb methods\n\nget(url, input)\npost(url, input)\nput(url, input)\npatch(url, input)\ndelete(url, input)\n\nArgument types\nEach REST verb method must be provided a url string as the first argument. The second argument (optional) can be in 2 forms.\nFirstly, input can be passed as a single hash. This hash can simply be the input of the execute or poll argument, such as the following:\nexecute: lambda do |connection, input|\n  get(\"https://www.some_api_endpoint.com/api\", input)\nend\n\nThe hash can also be formed before like this:\nexecute: lambda do |connection, input|\n  params = {\n    \"id\" => input[\"id\"]\n  }\n\n  get(\"https://www.some_api_endpoint.com/api\", params)\nend\n\nThe SDK framework processes this hash value and transforms it into the respective data format. For GET requests, the hash data is formed as part of URL parameters. For POST, PUT and PATCH, a payload body will be generated.\nThe other method of passing request data is as a series of key/value pairs.\nexecute: lambda do |connection, input|\n  post(\"https://www.some_api_endpoint.com/api\", name: input[\"name\"], email: input[\"email\"])\nend\n\nAll arguments after the first (URL string) will be transformed into request data. In this case, since the default data format is JSON, the following request body is formed:\n{\n  \"name\": \"Ee Shan\",\n  \"email\": \"eeshan@workato.com\"\n}\n\nFor a GET request, the following URL parameters are formed.\nexecute: lambda do |connection, input|\n  get(\"https://www.some_api_endpoint.com/api\", name: input[\"name\"], email: input[\"email\"])\nend\n\nThe request URL query string will be:\n?name%3DEe%20Shan%26email%3Deeshan%40workato.com\nRuby methods\n\n\n\nMethod\nDescription\n\n\n\n\neach\nBasic iterator`[1, 2, 3].each { \\\ni\\\nputs i }`\n\n\ngroup_by\nGroup arrays into sets\n\n\nheaders\nAdd headers to a request.headers(Authorization: \"Bearer HTB674HJK1\")\n\n\nparams\nAdd parameter to a request.params(api_key: \"HTB674HJK1\")\n\n\npayload\nAdd payload to a request.payload(id: \"345\")\n\n\nignored\nIgnore a comma-separate list of fieldsobject_definition[\"user\"].ignored(\"id\", \"created_at\")\n\n\nonly\nWhite list a comma-separate  of fieldsobject_definition[\"user\"].only(\"id\", \"name\")\n\n\nrequired\nMake a comma-separate list of fields requiredobject_definition[\"user\"].required(\"id\", \"created_at\")\n\n\ninject\nCombine elements in an array using an operation\n\n\niso8601\nConvert a date/date-time variable to ISO8601 format\n\n\nmap\nReturns a new array after invoking block on each element\n\n\nmerge\nReturns a new hash containing merged contents of another hash\n\n\npluck\nSelect one or more attributes from an array of objects[{\"id\": 1, \"name\": \"David\"},{\"id\": 2, \"name\": \"Peter\"}].pluck(\"id\") returns [1, 2]\n\n\nrand\nRandom number between 0 and 1\n\n\nselect\nSelectively returns elements for which the block returns true\n\n\nreject\nSelectively returns elements for which the block returns false (similar but opposite of select)\n\n\nsort\nSort function returning new sorted array\n\n\nsort_by\nSort function returning self\n\n\nutc\nConvert Time to utc\n\n\nputs\nruby version of console.log/stdout, not the same as put\n\n\nwhile\nwhile loop statement\n\n\n\n(This list can and will be expanded constantly, feel free to contact us to update/add to this list)\n"},"developing-connectors/sdk/pick-list.html":{"url":"developing-connectors/sdk/pick-list.html","title":"Pick lists","keywords":"","body":"Pick List\nA pick list is list of choices predefined for a user to select instead of having to input the actual values.\nIt is useful when there is a list of accepted values for a field or when the field requires a value that is not visible. For example, a field that requires User ID will require a pick list that displays the User names and pass the corresponding User's ID to that field.\nDefining a pick list\nThere are 2 ways to define a pick list: dynamically or statically.\nStatic example:\nPick list is defined as a array of selections. Each selection is an array made up of 2 elements.\nThe first element in the selection array is the value displayed and the second element is the value of that selection.\npick_lists: {\n  folder: lambda do |connection|\n    [\n      # Display name, value\n      [\"Root\",\"111390\"],\n      [\"Recycle Bin\",\"235611\"]\n    ]\n  end\n}\n\nDynamic example:\npick_lists: {\n  folder: lambda do |connection|\n    get(\"https://www.wrike.com/api/v3/folders\")[\"data\"].\n      map { |folder| [folder[\"title\"], folder[\"id\"]] }\n  end\n}\n\nAfter making a GET requests for all folders available, the pick list is populated with folder ids and displays the corresponding folder title\nUsage\ninput_fields: lambda do |object_definitions|\n  [\n    { name: \"folder_id\", control_type: \"select\", pick_list: \"folder\" }\n  ]\nend\n\n"},"developing-connectors/sdk/config-fields.html":{"url":"developing-connectors/sdk/config-fields.html","title":"Configuration fields","keywords":"","body":"Configuration Fields\nOccassionally, input/output fields depend on user input. For example, the fields for an object depends on the chosen object. Here, we introduce config_fields. It is an optional key available in both actions and triggers. It is a special type of input field that can be used to generate other dependent input/output fields. We see this in the merge_document action in Webmerge.\naction: {\n  merge_document: {\n    config_fields: [\n      # this field shows up first in recipe as a picklist of documents to use\n      {\n        name: \"document_id\",\n        label: \"Document\",\n        control_type: :select,\n        pick_list: \"documents\",\n        optional: false\n      }\n    ],\n\n    input_fields: lambda do |object_definition|\n      object_definition[\"document\"]\n    end,\n\n    execute: lambda do |_connection, input|\n      d = input[\"document_id\"].split(\"|\")\n      post(d.last.to_s, input)\n    end,\n\n    output_fields: lambda do |_object_definition|\n      [\n        {\n          name: \"success\"\n        }\n      ]\n    end\n  }\n}\n\nHere, the fields are different for each document, hence a user first chooses a document (from a pick list of documents available in the instance) which is then used to generate the remaining fields. This part is done by specifying that the \"document\" object definition is dependent on the value of \"document_id\" within config_field. Notice that the fields block accepts a second argument config_fields. This argument refers to the field(s) you define in config_fields in each action/trigger.\nobject_definition: {\n  document: {\n    fields: lambda do |_connection, config_fields|\n      return [] if config_fields.blank?\n      get(\"https://www.webmerge.me/api/documents/#{config_fields[\"document_id\"]}/fields\").\n        map { |field| field.slice(\"name\") }\n    end\n  }\n}\n\nWhile the config_fields is empty, document objects will have no fields (empty array of fields). As soon as config_fields is given a value, a request is made to retrieve the fields present in this document. From a recipe user perspective, the action will appear initially as a single input with a list of documents. After selecting a document, the corresponding set of fields will be generated, to be used in the recipe.\n\n Configuration fields in action\n"},"developing-connectors/sdk/examples.html":{"url":"developing-connectors/sdk/examples.html","title":"Examples","keywords":"","body":"Example Adapters\nBasic Authentication Samples\n\nHarvest app connector\n\nFreshdesk connector\n\nClearbit connector\n\nClose.io connector\n\nClick Time connector\n\nToggl connector\n\nUnbounce connector\n\nWatson Tone Analyzer connector\n\nDocparser connector\n\n\nOAuth2 Samples\n\nPodio connector\n\nProductHunt connector\n\nAccelo connector\n\nPushbullet connector\n\nWrike connector\n\nCisco Spark connector\n\nAMcards connector\n\n\nAPI Key Authentication Samples\n\nGender API connector\n\nHipchat connector\n\nCodeship connector\n\n\nCustom Authentication Samples\n\nLoJack app connector\n\nSafetyCulture app connector\n\nKnack HQ connector\n\nNeto connector\n\nTSheets connector\n\n\nCheck out the full list of example custom adapters built by developers here\n"},"developing-connectors/sdk/publishing-process.html":{"url":"developing-connectors/sdk/publishing-process.html","title":"Publishing process","keywords":"","body":""},"contact-us.html":{"url":"contact-us.html","title":"Contact us","keywords":"","body":"Contact us\nYou can always contact us to file an enhancement request or a bug report.
