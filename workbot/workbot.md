# Workbot for Slack
Workbot for Slack is a Workato chatbot that helps you monitor and interact with your business apps from within Slack.

Your team can configure Workbot to post notifications to Slack channels when important events happen, such as when a key customer files a ticket, a lead from a Fortune 500 company fills in a form on your website, or when a DevOps alert is created.

You can also retrieve information from your apps and post it to Slack, or create and update business data from within Slack. To cut down on notifications volume, apps can now send you smart notifications based on user-specified filters.

By default, Workbot comes with a set of pre-built recipes that allows you to interact with your applications and enable notifications with minimal setup.

## Notes

1. Make sure that Workbot is always in the channel to run commands. Do this by inviting it to the channel.
2. Just like talking to a real person, always use @workbot because you want it to be alerted.
3. When you talk to Workbot in his direct message channel, you do not need to use @workbot because it knows you are talking to it.
4. When you invite Workbot into the channel, **anyone** in that channel can interact with Workbot via commands.
5. When first installing Workbot into your Slack team, Workbot will detect the **latest** app connections you have made in your Workato account and automatically connect to them.
