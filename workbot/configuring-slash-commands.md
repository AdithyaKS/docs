# Configuring a slash command
To use slash commands, you first need to [create a custom bot](/workbot/workbot-custom-bots.md).

A slash command is a useful Workbot for Slack trigger that can be used to invoke dialogs and/or other recipe actions.

Slash commands must be added and configured under a custom bot in Slack before they can be used in Workato. If you already have a custom bot, proceed on to learn how to configure slash commands with your custom bot.

### Slash command input

The table below shows the input schema for a slash command.

<table class="unchanged rich-diff-level-one">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Field</th>
            <th>Explanation</th>
            <th>What goes in here</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Commands</td>
          <td>Name of slash command.</td>
          <td>
            Must begin with a ‘/’ and contain no spaces e.g. /createissue.<br><a href="/workbot/configuring-slash-commands.md#new-slash-command">Learn more.</a>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Command input fields</td>
          <td>
          Input required from user <br>E.g. <code>/createissue Urgent bug; Button not working; jandonyada
          </td>
          <td>
          Input fields required from user when invoking the slash command. Fields are separated by semicolons by default. <a href="/workbot/configuring-slash-commands.md#command-input-fields">Learn more.</a>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Request URL</td>
          <td>
            When slash commands are invoked, requests should be sent to this URL.
          </td>
          <td>
            Generated by Workato. Paste this URL into the corresponding slash command in Slack under <b>Request URL</b>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Short description</td>
          <td>
            Describe how to key in command input parameters.
          </td>
          <td>
            Copy & paste this into the "Short Description" field in the slash command of your custom Slack app. <a href="/workbot/configuring-slash-commands.md#short-description">Learn more.</a>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Usage hints</td>
          <td>
          Shows user the correct syntax for keying in command input parameters e.g.<br>
<code>/createissue [issue]; [description]; [assignee]</code>
          </td>
          <td>
          Copy & paste this into the “Usage Hints” field in the slash command of your custom Slack app. <a href="/workbot/configuring-slash-commands.md#usage-hints">Learn more.</a>
          </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>


### New slash command
To get started,
- Create a new recipe
- Under **Application**, choose **Workbot for Slack**
- Under **Trigger**, choose **New slash command**

![New slash command trigger](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-slash-commands/new-slash-command-trigger.png)*Some of the fields to be copy+pasted in Slack will appear only after defining the slash command*

### Command
Next, key in the name of your slash command. Slash commands should be named after the function it performs, e.g.

<code>/createissue, /listusers, /showcustomers</code>

Slash command actions must start with a slash, be all lowercase and contain no spaces. This slash command will also need to be created in your custom bot in Slack, but we'll get to that later.

![Slash command name example](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-slash-commands/slash-command-name.png)

### Command input fields
![Command input fields](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-slash-commands/command-input-fields.png)*Command input fields*

 Slash commands will most likely require input from the user before it can execute recipe actions, e.g. <br><code>/createissue Urgent bug; Button not working; jandonyada.</code> Hence, command input fields are a crucial part of slash commands.

 Command input fields let you define:
 - **Name** of input
 - **Data type** of input
 - Whether or not the field is **optional**

 ![Define a command input](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-slash-commands/define-a-command-input.png)

We'll also help to generate the [short description](/workbot/configuring-slash-commands.md#short-description) and [usage hints](/workbot/configuring-slash-commands.md#usage-hints) from the command input fields you specify. However, it's important to note that the order in which the user keys in the command input fields is *fixed*, and must be separated by semicolons.

### Request URL
When slash commands are invoked from Slack, Slack will require a URL to send requests to. This URL is generated by Workato, and is unique to the slash command used in each recipe. This request URL will be need to be set in your custom bot in Slack, but we'll get to that later.

![Request URL](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-slash-commands/request-url.png)

### Short description
When configuring the slash command in Slack, you'll need to provide a short description about the slash command.

This description will be shown in the Slack autocomplete function like so:

![Short description in Slack](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-slash-commands/short-description-in-slack.png)

In the slash command trigger, we'll assist in generating the short description based on the command input fields you specified earlier on - but you're free to customize this as you see fit.

![Help short description](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-slash-commands/help-short-description.png)

### Usage hints
When configuring the slash command in Slack, you'll need to provide usage hints about the slash command.

This description will be shown in the Slack autocomplete function like so:

![Short description in Slack](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-slash-commands/usage-hints-in-slack.png)

In the slash command trigger, we'll assist in generating the usage hints based on the command input fields you specified earlier on - but you're free to customize this as you see fit.

Once again, it's important to note that the order in which the user keys in the command input fields is *fixed*, and must be separated by semicolons.

![Help short description](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-slash-commands/help-short-description.png)

Save the recipe - but keep this tab open. We'll need it to create the slash command on Slack.

### Creating the slash command on Slack
Remember the trigger info at the start of the slash command recipe? It should now be populated with the info required to create the slash command in Slack.

![Configured slash command trigger](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-slash-commands/configured-slash-command-trigger.png)*Command, Request URL, Short Description, and Usage hints generated!*

To start creating your slash command, head to https://api.slack.com/apps and go to your custom bot.

![Custom bot](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-slash-commands/custom-bot.png)*Click on your custom bot*

Under **Slash Commands**, click on **Create New Command**

![Create new command](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-slash-commands/create-new-slash-command-slack.png)*Click on **Create New Command***

In the following form, populate the fields based on the trigger info at the start of the slash command recipe:

![Configuring new slash command in Slack](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-slash-commands/configuring-new-slash-command-slack.png)

Under **Escape channels, users, and links sent to your app**, check the box to enable it. This tells Slack to escape users and channels in their request payload to us.

At the bottom of the form, you can see a nifty preview of how the slash command will look like in Slack.

![Slash command preview in Slack](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-slash-commands/slash-command-preview-slack.png)

Click **Save** to finish creating the slash command.

You may have to reinstall the app to your workspace after hitting **Save**. Click on **Click here** in the marquee that shows up to reinstall the app.

![Reinstall app](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-slash-commands/reinstall-app.png)

After installing/reinstalling your custom bot, slash commands should now be ready for use as a trigger for your Workbot recipes!

![Slash command configured!](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-slash-commands/slash-commands-configured.png)*You can add more slash commands to the same bot, but make sure their names are unique*

You can add more slash commands to the same custom bot - but since slash commands are not namespaced, make sure to uniquely name each slash command in a Slack team.
