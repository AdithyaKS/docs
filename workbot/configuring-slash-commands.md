# Configuring a slash command
A slash command is another way to trigger Workbot commands. There are 2 methods you can configure slash commands; by connecting a custom bot, or by a legacy slash command (Custom Integrations).

We strongly recommend using custom bots to configure your slash command, as custom integration is a legacy method that will eventually be deprecated (no news as to when just yet).

#### Slash command using custom bots
To use this method, you first need to [create a custom bot](/workbot/workbot-custom-bots.md).

These slash commands must be added and configured under a custom bot in Slack before they can be used in Workato.

If you already have a custom bot, proceed on to learn how to configure slash commands with your custom bot.

#### Input
The table below shows the input schema for a slash command.

<table class="unchanged rich-diff-level-one">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Field</th>
            <th>Explanation</th>
            <th>What goes in here</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Commands</td>
          <td>Name of slash command.</td>
          <td>
            Must begin with a ‘/’ and contain no spaces e.g. /createissue.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Request URL</td>
          <td>
            When slash commands are invoked, requests should be sent to this URL.
          </td>
          <td>
            Generated by Workato. Paste this URL into the corresponding slash command in Slack under <b>Request URL</b>.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Short description</td>
          <td>
            Describe how to key in command input parameters.
          </td>
          <td>
            Copy & paste this into the "Short Description" field in the slash command of your custom Slack app.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Usage hint</td>
          <td>
          Shows user the correct syntax for keying in command input parameters e.g.<br>
<code>/createissue [issue]; [description]; [assignee]</code>
          </td>
          <td>
          Copy & paste this into the “Usage Hint” field in the slash command of your custom Slack app.
          </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>


### Getting started
To get started,
- Create a new recipe
- Under **Application**, choose **Workbot for Slack**
- Under **Trigger**, choose **New command**

Fill in the post command fields as you normally would. Next, move on to the slash command group.

### Slash command group

#### Command
Key in the name of your slash command. Slash commands should be named after the function it performs, e.g.

<code>/createissue, /listusers, /showcustomers</code>

Slash command actions must start with a slash and contain no spaces. This slash command will also need to be created in your custom bot in Slack, but we'll get to that later.

![Slash command name example](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-slash-commands/slash-command-name.png)

Using the command name and command input fields in the command trigger, we'll help to generate the [short description](/workbot/configuring-slash-commands.md#short-description) and [usage hint](/workbot/configuring-slash-commands.md#usage-hints) from the command input fields you specify. However, it's important to note that the order in which the user keys in the command input fields is *fixed*, and will be separated by semicolons.

#### Request URL
When slash commands are invoked from Slack, Slack will require a URL to send requests to. This URL is generated by Workato, and is unique to the slash command used in each recipe. This request URL will need to be set in your custom bot in Slack, but we'll get to that later.

![Request URL](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-slash-commands/request-url.png)

#### Short description
When configuring the slash command in Slack, you'll need to provide a short description about the slash command.

This description will be shown in the Slack autocomplete function like so:

![Short description in Slack](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-slash-commands/short-description-in-slack.png)

In the slash command trigger, we'll assist in generating the short description based on the command input fields you specified earlier on - but you're free to customize this as you see fit.

![Help short description](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-slash-commands/help-short-description.png)

#### Usage hint
When configuring the slash command in Slack, you'll need to provide a usage hint about the slash command.

This description will be shown in the Slack autocomplete function like so:

![Short description in Slack](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-slash-commands/usage-hints-in-slack.png)

In the slash command trigger, we'll assist in generating the usage hint based on the command input fields you specified earlier on - but you're free to customize this as you see fit.

Once again, it's important to note that the order in which the user keys in the command input fields is *fixed*, and must be separated by semicolons.

![Help short description](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-slash-commands/help-short-description.png)

Save the recipe - but keep this tab open. We'll need it to create the slash command on Slack.

#### Creating the slash command on Slack
The trigger should now be equipped with the info required to create the slash command in Slack.

![Configured slash command trigger](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-slash-commands/configured-slash-command-trigger.png)*Command, Request URL, Short Description, and usage hint generated!*

To start creating your slash command, head to https://api.slack.com/apps and go to your custom bot.

![Custom bot](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-slash-commands/custom-bot.png)*Click on your custom bot*

Under **Slash Commands**, click on **Create New Command**

![Create new command](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-slash-commands/create-new-slash-command-slack.png)*Click on **Create New Command***

In the following form, populate the fields based on the trigger info at the start of the slash command recipe:

![Configuring new slash command in Slack](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-slash-commands/configuring-new-slash-command-slack.png)

Under **Escape channels, users, and links sent to your app**, check the box to enable it. This tells Slack to escape users and channels in their request payload to us.

At the bottom of the form, you can see a nifty preview of how the slash command will look like in Slack.

![Slash command preview in Slack](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-slash-commands/slash-command-preview-slack.png)

Click **Save** to finish creating the slash command.

You may have to reinstall the app to your workspace after hitting **Save**. Click on **Click here** in the marquee that shows up to reinstall the app.

![Reinstall app](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-slash-commands/reinstall-app.png)

After installing/reinstalling your custom bot, the slash command should now be ready for use as a trigger for your Workbot recipes!

![Slash command configured!](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-slash-commands/slash-commands-configured.png)*You can add more slash commands to the same bot, but make sure their names are unique*

You can add more slash commands to the same custom bot - but since slash commands are not namespaced, make sure to uniquely name each slash command in a Slack team.

### Legacy slash commands
To use this method, you first need to add the slash command custom integration to your Slack workspace.

This custom integration will work in conjunction with Workbot to execute your recipes.

### Input (legacy)
The table below shows the input schema for a custom integrations slash command.

<table class="unchanged rich-diff-level-one">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Field</th>
            <th>Explanation</th>
            <th>What goes in here</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Command</td>
          <td>Name of slash command.</td>
          <td>
            Must begin with a ‘/’ and contain no spaces e.g. /createissue.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>URL</td>
          <td>
            When slash commands are invoked, requests should be sent to this URL.
          </td>
          <td>
            Generated by Workato. Paste this URL into the corresponding slash command in Slack under <b>Request URL</b>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Description</td>
          <td>
            Describe how to key in command input parameters.
          </td>
          <td>
            Copy & paste this into the "Short Description" field in the slash command of your custom Slack app.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Usage hint</td>
          <td>
          Shows user the correct syntax for keying in command input parameters e.g.<br>
<code>/createissue [issue]; [description]; [assignee]</code>
          </td>
          <td>
          Copy & paste this into the “Usage Hint” field in the slash command of your custom Slack app.
          </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>


#### Add Slash Commands to Custom Integrations
To do so, head over to https://your-workspace.slack.com//apps/A0F82E8CA-slash-commands e.g. https://workato.slack.com//apps/A0F82E8CA-slash-commands.

![Add configuration](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-slash-commands/add-configuration.png)

Click on **Add Configuration**. Key in the name of your slash command. Slash commands should be named after the function it performs, e.g.

<code>/createissue, /listusers, /showcustomers</code>

Next, click on **Add Slash Command Integration**. You should now be at the Slash Command settings page. Scroll down to **Integration Settings**. Under **Token**, copy the value in the field e.g. `22eBaBNWIYkvVarrw6EgPIG5` - we'll need this when configuring the Workbot connection in Workato. Keep this tab open - we'll come back to it later.

![Integration Settings](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-slash-commands/integration-settings.png)

#### Configuring the Workbot connection
From your Workato account, go to the connection for the Workbot you want to use slash commands with. Under **Slash commands verification tokens**, paste the **Token** value you copied earlier. Click **Connect** and authorize the conneciton.

![Slash command verification token](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-slash-commands/slash-command-verification-token.png)

Done! Workbot is now connected to the custom integration slash command. Next, we need to configure the Workbot recipe to talk to the custom integration slash command.

### Getting started (again)
To get started,
- Create a new recipe
- Under **Application**, choose **Workbot for Slack**
- Under **Trigger**, choose **New command**

Fill in the post command fields as you normally would. Next, move on to the slash command group.

#### Slash command group (legacy)

This description will be shown in the Slack autocomplete function like so:

![Description in Slack](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-slash-commands/short-description-in-slack.png)

In the slash command trigger, we'll assist in generating the description based on the command input fields you specified earlier on - but you're free to customize this as you see fit.

![Help short description](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-slash-commands/help-short-description.png)

#### Usage hint (legacy)
When configuring the slash command in custom integrations, you'll need to provide a usage hint about the slash command.

Save the recipe - but keep this tab open. We'll need it to finish configuring the slash command on Slack.

#### Closing the loop - configuring the slash command in Custom Integrations

The recipe trigger should now be equipped with the info required to create the slash command in Slack.

In your Slack tab (you kept it open, right?), you should now be at https://your-workspace.slack.com//apps/A0F82E8CA-slash-commands, under **Integration Settings**.

- Under **URL**, paste in the **URL** from the recipe trigger earlier.

Next, scroll down to **Autocomplete help text**.

- Under **Description**, paste in the **Description** from the recipe trigger earlier.

- Under **Usage hint**, paste in the **Usage hint** from the recipe trigger earlier.

- Turn on  **Escape channels, users, and links sent to your app** and
- Check the box for Translate global enterprise IDs to local workspace IDs.

![Autocomplete help text](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-slash-commands/autocomplete-help-text.png)

Click on **Save Integration** to finish configuring the custom integrations slash command.

Try it out! Head to your Slack workspace and invoke the slash command to trigger your Workbot recipes.
