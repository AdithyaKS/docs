# Workato actions
Workbot actions allow Workbot to post notifications into a specified channel when there are events to take note of, or respond to a command.

Workbot supports 2 actions:
* Post command reply
* Post notifications

## Post command reply
Post command reply allows you to customize how Workbot replies when an event is completed. This reply can be a simple message about the task completion, or a prompt for the user to take a subsequent action once the first has been done, e.g. after retrieving data for a custom account in Salesforce, ask if the user wishes to copy that information across to another application.

Here is what the Post Command Reply action's output will look like in Slack.

## Post notifications
This action allows you to post customized notifications to Slack channels.

The fields available are simillar to that of the **Post command reply** action, with all the typical fields you see in a Slack message. However, there is the addition of the field **Notification Filter**. This field allows you to set parameters for filters, which acts like a trigger filter for sending out notifications (i.e. the notification will only get sent when the set criteria is met).
