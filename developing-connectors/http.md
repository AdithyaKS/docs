<!--- Didn't want to import the data from Articulate since we're working on a new UI for HTTP. Let's come back to this when the new design is on production. -->

# HTTP connector
The HTTP connector enables integration with any cloud applications that has a HTTP based API. You can create a new connector as well as add new triggers or actions to existing Workato connectors.

There are 2 types of HTTP connectors 1. standard auth and variations 2. Oauth 2

## Difference between HTTP and HTTP (Oauth2) connector
Apart from the authentication flow for the connection, the functionalities of both connectors are the same. The process of configuring webhook triggers, polling triggers and REST actions are identical.

For non-OAuth2 connections, an additional test API request is required to ascertain that the connection is valid.
