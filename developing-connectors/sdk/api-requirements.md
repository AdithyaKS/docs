# API Requirements

## Format

Presently, we support the following types
  - JSON
  - XML
  - www-form-urlencoded
  - multipart-form

## Good to have

### Pagination

Pagination helps with response data that is more manageable. It is definitely a bonus if the intended API supports that.

### Query

It is very useful to be able to query resources instead of locating them based on IDs. With Search by query, the API allows you to return a list of results that matches your field criterias. You may also want to look out for the ability to query based on created/updated time which will be crucial when building out your triggers.
