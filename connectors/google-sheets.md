# Google Sheets

The query function can be used to search for a specific row in Google Sheets. A **Search query** is an expression that you set to return certain results. For example, if the name of a column is “user id”, and you want to find the row that has the value **userid** in this column, your **Search query** would be “userid = **userid**”.

 *Query search with "="*

You can also use !=, >, <, !>, and !< in your query expression.
