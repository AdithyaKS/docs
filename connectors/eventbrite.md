## Eventbrite: Recipe not picking up trigger events
Eventbrite allows you to have multi-user access. You can check this by going to account settings. If you have multi-user access and you are not the administrator the recipe will not pick up events. To correct this situation reconnect to Eventbrite with administrator's access credentials.
