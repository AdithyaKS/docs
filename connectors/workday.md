# Workday

Workday has multiple web services that can be used to integration data. Workday SOAP API provides a set of operations to read and write data in and out of Workday while the Workday Report-as-a-Service allows reading data from all custom reports (must be web service enabled first). Workato uses these services to create powerful integration scenarios to enhance Human Capital Management.
