# Amazon S3

[Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) allows users to store important data and solves the issue of increasing need for storage but lack of resources. The system allows users to set up 'buckets' at any location to fill with any data and information (objects) they wish to safeguard. Additional precaution is also taken to prevent any loss of information so the data is always copied and kept safe.

Workato has 3 main triggers from [Amazon S3](https://www.workato.com/integrations/amazons3); these triggers are New CSV file, New file, and New file slice. Through thi, Workato users can move large amounts of data and organize it in any way they chose. A new uploaded file into a S3 bucket, for example, can cause an emial to be sent verifying that a new object has been added to the bucket.

## Connector information

### API version
The S3 connector uses [Amazon S3 REST API, version 2006-03-01](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/Welcome.html).

## How to connect to Amazon S3 on Workato

### Amazon S3 connection
The S3 connector uses the [AWS Signature Version 4](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html) to authenticate to Amazon S3.

### Roles and permissions required to connect
To enable programmatic access to S3 via Workato, the authenticated user needs to have an access key (an access key ID and a secret access key) in S3. Best practices for creating an integration user with the correct set of permissions can be found in the [Amazon documentation on creating an IAM user](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html).

## Working with the S3 connector

### [S3 Terminology](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/AmazonS3Basics.html)

* **Buckets**

  Buckets are containers that hold objects. The geographical region where this bucket and its contents will be stored can be defined by the user.

* **Objects**

  An object consists of a file, and optionally any metadata describing that file.


### Using the new file trigger
The new file trigger listens to new files uploaded into a specific S3 bucket. The trigger event contains only metadata about the file, however, such as file name and size. To retreieve content of the file, use the **Download file** action.

## Troubleshooting

### Exact, case sensitive names
When defining bucket and object by names in S3, take note that names should be exact and are case sensitive.
