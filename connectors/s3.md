# Amazon S3
[Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) is a web service offered by Amazon Web Services, that provides scalable and highly flexible cloud storage through web services interfaces.

## API version
The S3 connector uses [Amazon S3 REST API, version 2006-03-01](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/Welcome.html).

## How to connect to Amazon S3 on Workato
The S3 connector uses the [AWS Signature Version 4](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html) to authenticate to Amazon S3.

There are 2 ways to connect to Amazon S3:
1) Using Access Key
2) Using IAM role.

### Connect to Amazon S3 using Access Key
To use this authentication method, you need to provide the access key of an [IAM User](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.html) in your S3 system.

Workato will log in to your S3 as this IAM User to do automation. The IAM User should have proper permission, ideally List/Read/Write permission to specific buckets & folders.

Refer to [Amazon documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html) on how to create an IAM User.

### Connect to Amazon S3 using IAM role
To use this authentication method, you need to provide an [IAM Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) in your S3 system. Note that this is different from an [IAM User](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.html).

By doing this, you will allow an external Workato's S3 account to assume a role in your S3 system. In this case, Workato does not log in as an user in your S3, so you do not need to provide your own access key.

The IAM Role should have proper permission to do automation, ideally List/Read/Write permission to specific buckets & folders.

Learn more about IAM Role and granting access to third-party in the [Amazon documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user.html).

## Working with the S3 connector

### S3 Terminology
The [terminology](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/AmazonS3Basics.html) for common S3 data can be found below.

- **Buckets**

Buckets are containers that hold objects. The geographical region where this bucket and its contents will be stored can be defined by the user.

- **Objects**

An object consists of a file, and optionally any metadata describing that file.

### Using the new file trigger
The new file trigger listens to new files uploaded into a specific S3 bucket. The trigger event contains only metadata about the file, however, such as file name and size. To retrieve content of the file, use the **Download file** action.

## Troubleshooting

### Exact, case sensitive names
When defining bucket and object by names in S3, take note that names should be exact and are case sensitive.
