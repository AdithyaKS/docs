# Amazon S3

## Connector information

### API version
The S3 connector uses [Amazon S3 REST API, version 2006-03-01](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/Welcome.html).

## How to connect to Amazon S3 on Workato

### Amazon S3 connection
The S3 connector uses the [AWS Signature Version 4](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html) to authenticate to Amazon S3.

### Roles and permissions required to connect
To enable programmatic access to S3 via Workato, the authenticated user needs to have an access key (an access key ID and a secret access key) in S3. Best practices for creating an integration user with the correct set of permissions can be found in the [Amazon documentation on creating an IAM user](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html).

## Working with the S3 connector

### [S3 Terminology](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/AmazonS3Basics.html)

* **Buckets**

  Buckets are containers that hold objects. The geographical region where this bucket and its contents will be stored can be defined by the user.

* **Objects**

  An object consists of a file, and optionally any metadata describing that file.


### Using the new file trigger
The new file trigger listens to new files uploaded into a specific S3 bucket. The trigger event contains only metadata about the file, however, such as file name and size. To retreieve content of the file, use the **Download file** action.

## Troubleshooting

### Exact, case sensitive names
When defining bucket and object by names in S3, take note that names should be exact and are case sensitive.

### Salesforce Error: 400 Bad Request

If the error reads **400 Bad Request: [{"message":"invalid query locator","errorCode":"INVALID_QUERY_LOCATOR"}]** ,

This has to do with having too many recipes triggering based on the same Salesforce Object (eg. Accounts, Leads). Salesforce can have up to 10 query cursors open at a time. If 10 Query Locator cursors are open with Workato, using the same user account, attempts to open a new one, then the oldest of the 10 cursors is released. If Workato attempts to open the released query cursor, an error results.

To solve this, you can merge similar recipe that trigger based on the same object and use conditional actions to achieve the tasks of the original recipes
