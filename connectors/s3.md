# Amazon S3
[Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) is a web service offered by Amazon Web Services, that provides scalable and highly flexible cloud storage through web services interfaces.

## API version
The S3 connector uses [Amazon S3 REST API, version 2006-03-01](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/Welcome.html).

## How to connect to Amazon S3 on Workato
The S3 connector uses the [AWS Signature Version 4](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html) to authenticate to Amazon S3. There are 2 ways to connect:
1) Using Access Key
2) Using IAM role.

### Connect to Amazon S3 using Access Key
This is the most simple way to connect to S3. To use this authentication method, you just need to provide the access key of an [IAM User](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.html) in your S3 system.

Workato will log in to your S3 as this IAM User to do automation. The IAM User should have enough permission, ideally List/Read/Write permission to specific buckets & folders.

Refer to [Amazon documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html) on how to create an IAM User.

### Connect to Amazon S3 using IAM Role
If you do not prefer to share your S3 access key, you can connect using [IAM Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html).

In this method, you will create an IAM Role for an external Workato S3 account to access your S3. Learn more about IAM Role and granting access to third-party in this [Amazon documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user.html).

Follow these steps to create the proper IAM Role for Workato:
1. In S3, select `My Security Credentials` under your username.

2. Select `Roles` > `Create role`.

3. Input Workato S3 `Account ID` (**353360065216**). Type in an `External ID` and record this down, you will need it later to setup the S3 connector in Workato.

4. Select a proper permission for Workato to run automation in your S3. At the mininum, Workato should have List/Read/Write access to specific buckets or folders. In this tutorial, we will select `AmazonS3FullAccess`.

5. Give this IAM Role name & description.

6. The IAM Role is now created. Open the role.

7. Copy the Role ARN. You will need it later to setup the S3 connector in Workato.

## Working with Amazon S3 connector

### S3 Terminology
The [terminology](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/AmazonS3Basics.html) for common S3 data can be found below.

- **Buckets**

Buckets are containers that hold objects. The geographical region where this bucket and its contents will be stored can be defined by the user.

- **Objects**

An object consists of a file, and optionally any metadata describing that file.

### Using the new file trigger
The new file trigger listens to new files uploaded into a specific S3 bucket. The trigger event contains only metadata about the file, however, such as file name and size. To retrieve content of the file, use the **Download file** action.

## Troubleshooting

### Exact, case sensitive names
When defining bucket and object by names in S3, take note that names should be exact and are case sensitive.
