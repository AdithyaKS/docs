# SurveyMonkey

[SurveyMonkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/) helps user build simple surveys for many uses including polls and market searchers.

With Workato, users can link results of a poll to different applications. For example, users of [SurveyMonkey](https://www.workato.com/integrations/surveymonkey) can build a recipe that can link a completed survey response to a spreadsheet on Google Sheets in order to easily organize these responses.
