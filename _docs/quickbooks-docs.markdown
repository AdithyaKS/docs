* **Username & Password**

  Login with your QuickBooks credentials and allow Workato to access your QuickBooks account. 

## Connecting to Multiple Companies on QuickBooks
If you have multiple Companies on your QuickBooks account, you can connect them to Workato using the same QuickBooks authentication. Simply create new connections for each Company.
However, if you have multiple Workato accounts and try to connect to the same Company, the earlier connection will be disconnected. Hence, we recommend that only 1 Workato account is used to connect to 1 Company to prevent any disruption to your recipes.
