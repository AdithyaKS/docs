# Formula
Formula mode is a toggled mode for almost any input field in Workato, allowing you to make use of special formulas to transform and manpiulate data according to your exact needs.
When you are defining the input for a field, you can be in Text mode or Formula mode, indicated by the box at the right of the field. 
You can toggle between the two modes by hovering your cursor over the top right hand corner of a field and simply clicking on the button.
