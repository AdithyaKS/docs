# Testing recipes

## Why is testing recipes necessary?
Testing recipes is a good practice. Workato is moving data and information from one business app to the other via the workflow described in recipes. Testing these workflows is critical to ensure that the information entered into the apps by Workato is accurate and does not include bad data. 


## Recipe Testing Basics
Recipes built on Workato can vary greatly in complexity. Building and running a 1-line recipe may be simple and straightforward, but as the recipe grows more intricate, understanding how to test and ensure the recipe is built correctly is vital.
