# Rerunning Jobs

## When do I need to rerun a job? 

### Testing a new recipe

During the testing phase, rerunning jobs is commonly used to fix the errors encountered in recipes. Rather than creating new trigger events, rerunning the same job will allow you to fix the errors 1 step at a time with the same event.

### Errors

When an error is detected in your recipes, an email will be sent to the Notifications email address specified in the Account Settings.

#### No fixing of the recipe is required
 
 If you face the following errors, rerun your job and the job should complete:

#### Errors that need fixing

When the error has a different code from the ones listed above, or if rerunning the jobs do not work, the recipe or data from the application needs to be fixed.

In the job report, look at the error code provided and make the changes accordingly.

## How to rerun a job

### Jobs Tab
Navigate to the 'Jobs' tab and to see a list of jobs that have been run. You can filter the jobs by 'Completed', 'Pending' and 'Failed'. 

Completed jobs are those that have successfully run through the recipe while failed jobs met with errors that stopped the job before it could be completed. 

Check the boxes on the left of each line and click 'Rerun'. You can rerun 10 jobs (1 page of jobs) at a time. 


### Job Report

The rerun job button is located on the top right hand corner of the job report page. Click on this to rerun the job and you will be re-directed to the 'Jobs' tab.

#### Rerun History
All rerun jobs have a history log at the bottom of the job report. Click on each line to view the previously run jobs.
