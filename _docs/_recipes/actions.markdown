# Data Types

Here are some of the object types and their logos.
The greyed values are what we call meta-data. The meta data allows you to take a peek at what kind of data does the field stores. Workato picks arbitrary a record field and uses it as the meta-data value.

# Mapping
Field Mapping is one of the strongest ability that Workato users possess. With the ability to retrieve, modify and store values in any fields, including custom fields, you can now move data across your applications with better control and stronger data pipelines.

The basics of Field Mapping in Workato is to understand what you're seeing in the recipe. Let's use this recipe for an example :

Taking the right data pill is just as important as setting up the right logic, when you choose the wrong data pill to work with, you are bounded to fall into errors.

   Empty Data pills on Required Fields
   Required fields must always have a value. To ensure that, you will always need to make sure that the field is filled up, either    with a data pill that always have a value, or using formula mode. Check out how you can use formula mode to choose a second data pill as a second choice here.

   Data pills from the wrong branch of logic
   When you used the recipe from the wrong branch of logic, you will definitely be meeting a data pill with empty value. This is because that data pill may come from a step that may never had been executed at all. To learn more about how to identify these issues, check out this video on how you can do so.
