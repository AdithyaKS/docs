# Starting and Stopping Recipes

## Starting Recipes

After successfully testing your recipes, start running them to automate your workflows. Click on 'Start recipe' and allow the recipe to run continually in the background. 

After you have started the recipe, the recipe becomes an 'Active' recipe. On your recipes page, you can filter by active recipes to see all the recipes currently running.

### Configuring the Administrator Email
When any errors that occur in the active recipes, an email will be sent to the Notifications Email you specify in the Account Settings. To add/change this email, click on your account name on the top right of your screen > Settings > Contact. 

## Stopping Recipes

### When do I stop my recipes?
Stop the recipes when they are no longer relevant. You can only delete recipes after they have been stopped. 

You should also stop the recipes that are running into constant errors or if you notice incorrect data passing into your applications as a result of the recipe and fix these errors.

### Why are my recipes automatically stopped?
There are 2 reasons for this:

  2. There are more than 60 consecutive trigger errors. When you receive this error message on your recipe, it means 
  
## What happens when I start a stopped recipe?
Starting a stopped recipe will pick up jobs from where it last stopped. 

For example, if I stopped my recipe on January 1st, 10:30pm, and start it again on January 10th, 7pm, it will begin picking up jobs from January 1st, 10:31pm onwards. 

If you wish for the recipe to only start picking up new jobs from January 10th onwards, copy the recipe and change the Since date.
