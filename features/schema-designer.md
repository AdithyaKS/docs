# Schema Designer Field

Previously when users use callable recipe, they have to know how to define input/output schema in the JSON format(screenshot below). This is not friendly for users are not familiar with such format and that often results in unnecessary formatting error even before they can start using the callable recipe.

**How we defined input and output schema previously:**

The newer version provides users with a more friendly way of defining their schema.

Thereâ€™s a default JSON sample available to set up the schema/gives example of how to define the schema. You can also access this JSON editor subsequently from the { } icon to the right of the label :

Subsequently, you can add or remove schema via the UI editor. You can also build the schema from scratch via the editor.
