# Common data model
The common data model, also known as the canonical data model or the abstratc data model, is a standard schema that organizations define in order to simplify data flow and interaction between the different applications they use across the organization. This enables integrations to be built based on the common data model instead of being based on the application - and as a result, minimizes impact on organizations when they add, edit or remove integrations and applications.

The common data model feature is enabled only for certain plans. Check the [Pricing and Plans page](https://www.workato.com/pricing?audience=general) or reach out to Workato sales representatives at +1 (844) 469-6752 to find out more.

## Applications of the common data model
The shared schemas created in the common data model in Workato can be currently used in the following connectors:
